Known for her sensual, metallic aesthetic–Marilyn Minter’s paintings, photographs (and videos) explore beauty and the feminine body in American culture. She questions the fashion/cosmetic industries’ collective commercialization of sex and the body. _Marilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty_ (on view at the Brooklyn Museum through April 2, 2017) is the artist’s first retrospective.
