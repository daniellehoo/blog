</div>As a last symphony of sorts before I quit my job at MoMA, I was on the key organizers of the event [PopRally x Items: BOOTLEGGED](https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/4007?locale=en). The event honored the bootleg in fashion in celebration of [*Items: Is Fashion Modern?*](https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/calendar/exhibitions/1638), MoMA’s first fashion exhibition in over 70 years, which closed on January 28.

</div>The celebration featured a DJ set by the legendary DJ duo [Stretch &amp; Bobbito](http://stretchandbobbito.com/), art-making, drinks, and dancing.

</div>The event featured original bootleg interpretations of the iconic MoMA logo on selected objects represented in the exhibition, by artists Kamoni Chandler aka A$AP K, Awol Erizku, Ava Nirui, and Mackenzie Younger. Guests were given the opportunity to show up wearing their favorite of the [111 items](https://medium.com/items/items-is-fashion-modern-checklist-e353b83e7652) featured in the exhibition for an opportunity to walk away with one of the exclusive limited-edition artist bootlegs.
