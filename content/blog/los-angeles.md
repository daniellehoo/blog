</div>At the beginning of the month, I spent a week in LA for a work trip. The last time I was in LA was 2008, and I spent part of that trip in Anaheim at Disneyland–so it was great to see the city through a completely different (art centric) lens. East Coasters and New Yorkers in particular love to hate on LA, but the trip was pretty great overall and I would definitely at least consider moving there.

Here’s a breakdown of the trip:

</div>**Friday, March 31**

I arrived late on Thursday night, after some delays and maybe the most turbulent flight I’ve ever experienced. Someone in the row behind me threw up and a teenager on a school trip kept flipping his tray table up and down (until I asked him to stop). I’m seated in a row right behind a set of bathrooms and there’s the looming smell of toilet in the air. I engage in a 6-hour armrest battle with my seat neighbor. Commercial flights are just filled with life’s small pleasures.

</div>The jet lag is real–I consistently woke up around 6:00 a.m. (EST) throughout the trip. This is what being a morning person must be like. Spent the day setting up at The Broad (for our meeting the following Monday). Then caught dinner with some colleagues at [Norah](http://norahrestaurant.com/).

</div>**Saturday, April 1**

This is the first official day of our work program. There are factions of architecture tours, artist studio visits, and private collection visits. Dinner with colleagues is held at [Republique](http://republiquela.com/).

</div>**Monday, April 3**

Our meeting is held at the Broad in the morning and we have lunch at [Manuela](http://www.manuela-la.com/) at [Hauser &amp; Wirth](https://www.hauserwirthlosangeles.com/) to view the [Jason Rhoades](https://www.hauserwirth.com/exhibitions/3073/jason-rhoades-installations-1994-y-2006/view/) exhibit. Our work program concludes with an Ed Ruscha studio visit. I have dinner with some colleagues at [ALMA at The Standard](http://www.standardhotels.com/la/features/alma-restaurant-hollywood) in West Hollywood.

</div>**Tuesday, April 4**

I make the rounds and visit the Power exhibition at [Sprueth Magers](http://www.spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/445), [LACMA](http://www.lacma.org/) and [The Hammer](https://hammer.ucla.edu/) (the [Jimmie Durham](https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2017/jimmie-durham-at-the-center-of-the-world/) show was excellent). I meet up with a high school friend in Marina del Rey with whom I crash with for the rest of my trip.

**Wednesday, April 5**

After a morning walk down to the marina (with bulletproof coffee in-hand), my friend and his girlfriend take me to Abbot Kinney Blvd (apparently the place for trendy LA shopping) and Venice Beach.

I make a stop at [The Underground Museum](http://theunderground-museum.org/) before meeting a college friend for dinner at [Kayndaves](https://kayndaves.com/) in Culver City.

**Thursday, April 6**

On my last day in LA, I manage to get it to the [Getty](http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/) (Center) for some amazing views of the city. The grounds (and garden) are pretty incredible, but the collection and exhibitions are definitely a bit hard to navigate since the building is basically housed in four separate factions (north, south, east and west).
