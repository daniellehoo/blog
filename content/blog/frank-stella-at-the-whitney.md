Frank Stella may be one of my favorite artists. His minimalist and ‘post-painterly’ works have undoubtedly paved the way for subsequent minimalist and post-minimalist works. The current Stella Retrospective at the Whitney is the most comprehensive to-date and features a wide array of the artist’s works from the 1950s through present. The show diverges from his most well-known works (the Black Series) and presents many lesser-known 3-D pieces from his later works.
