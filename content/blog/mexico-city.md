As part of my Masters program, we took a 5-day trip to Mexico City to survey the art and architecture scene there. The highlights of the trip included: The Museum Soumaya (amazing building, less than impressive collection/curation inside), Frida’s Casa Azul (I’ve been wanting to make a pilgrimage there for ages), the artist’s collective Casa Maauad, Galeria OMR, Kurimanzutto, attending a Lucha Libra fight, staying at the Camino Real Polanco, climbing the Teotihuacan ruins, visiting artist Pedro Reyes’ studio, visiting the Museo Jumux, visiting the Diego Rivera-Anahuacalli and seeing Casa Luis Barragan.

The following week, I traveled with 4 others from my program to Tulum–where we relaxed on the beach, swam in a cenote, hiked Tulum ruins and ate the most amazing Mexico food.
