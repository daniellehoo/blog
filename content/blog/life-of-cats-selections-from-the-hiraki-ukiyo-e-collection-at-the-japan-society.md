I have a three year old cat I adopted from the ASPCA when I first moved to New York. He’s a black cat and his name is Cesare after Cesare Borgia. Naturally, I’m a cat (and overall, an animal) lover and this exhibition, brought to my attention by a fellow Sotheby’s alum, clearly appealed to my interests. The selection of (mostly) Edo woodblock prints were whimsical and combined myth and folklore with history and culture.

From the [Japan Society’s](http://www.japansociety.org/event/life-of-cats-selections-from-the-hiraki-ukiyo-e-collection) press release:

“Since arriving in Japan aboard Japanese ships transporting sacred Buddhist scriptures from China in the mid-sixth century, cats have proceeded to purr and paw their way into the heart of Japanese life, folklore, and art. *Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection* illustrates the depth of this mutual attraction by mining the wealth of bravura depictions of cats to be found in ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the Edo Period (1615-1867). The exhibition is divided into five sections: Cats and People, Cats as People, Cats versus People, Cats Transformed and Cats and Play. 90 ukiyo-e prints in the exhibition are on loan from the esteemed Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation whose holdings are revered in Japan. Select prints, paintings, sculptures, and other works borrowed from U.S. collections complement these prints, making the exhibition over 120 artworks. With cross-cultural and multi-generational appeal, *Life of Cats* takes viewers on a wild ride through Japan’s love affair with our feline friends.”
