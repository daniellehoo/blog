This post is slightly outdated, but Richard Serra, 74, has new sculptures on display at both [Gagosian](http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-serra--october-26-2013) galleries in Chelsea (the exhibition runs until March 15 at the 555 West 24 Street Gallery and February 8 at the 522 West 21 Street Gallery). _Intervals_ (2013) (pictured above) is on display at the 555 West 24th Street Gallery. It features 24 weatherproof steel plates. Serra’s work is also featured as a permanent part of the Dia:Beacon collection. He is considered a minimalist artist (sculptor) and is known for his steels works that forcefully manipulate and contour the viewer’s body into a confined space. His background as a steel worker influenced his signature medium choice.

The space at the 522 gallery is dedicated to a single work made of curved, _Inside Out_ (2013) (pictured above). The work is maze-like and the large contours of the structure push the viewer into several space pockets while towering into the tall gallery space.
