After completing General Assembly's Web Development Immersive bootcamp, I spent about a month in London with my friend Anna who recently moved to a flat in Fitzrovia.

**Friday, June 22**

I went to the General Assembly campus in Whitechapel and stopped into the Whitechapel Gallery to see some art. That night Anna and I went to Queen of Hoxton in Shoreditch.

**Saturday, June 23**

Met up with my friend Joe (who I met 5 years prior in Croatia) and we all went to the Museum of Natural History. I also got a consultation at Good Times tattoo (but ultimately chickened out and didn't get it). Then Joe and I went to Old St. Records, another pub, and The Magic Roundabout (we drew pen tattoos on each other). We had dinner at an Indian spot on Brick Lane. He missed the last train to his town out of London and ended up sleeping at the station. We also saw someone who was possibly stabbed and walked streets littered with metal nitrous pods.
