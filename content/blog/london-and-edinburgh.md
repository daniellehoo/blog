After completing General Assembly's Web Development Immersive bootcamp, I spent about a month in London with my friend Anna who recently moved to a flat in Fitzrovia.

**Thursday, June 22  
  
**I arrived to London at around noon, met up with Anna, showered, napped and then Anna and I got dinner at a spot near her apt.

**Friday, June 22**

I went to the General Assembly campus in Whitechapel and stopped into the Whitechapel Gallery to see some art. That night Anna and I went to Queen of Hoxton in Shoreditch.

**Saturday, June 23**

Met up with my friend Joe (who I met 5 years prior in Croatia) and we all went to the Museum of Natural History. I also got a consultation at Good Times tattoo (but ultimately chickened out and didn't get it). Then Joe and I went to Old St. Records, another pub, and The Magic Roundabout (we drew pen tattoos on each other). We had dinner at an Indian spot on Brick Lane. He missed the last train to his town out of London and ended up sleeping at the station. We also saw someone who was possibly stabbed and walked streets littered with metal nitrous pods.

**Sunday, June 24**

I met up with my friend Harry who I met in Thailand, his sister Michaela, his friend visiting from Melbourne, Nick, and their other friend Timmy. We watched thee England/Panama World Cup game (England won 6-1) and then went to the park in Hackney near where Harry lives. 

**Monday, June 25**

Met up with Nick to go to the British Museum. We managed to cover most of the museum, got coffee, grabbed a bear, and then headed to. Shoreditch to have dinner for Harry's birthday at Flat Iron (a steak spot). Afterwards we watched some of the Iran vs. Portugal game at The Enchanted Garden.

**Tuesday, June 26**

Met up with Nick to go to the London Museum and then got coffee in a park. 

**Wednesday, June 27**

Went to the National Gallery solo. Got sick.

**Thursday, June 28**

Met up with Nick again to go to Camdenâ€”we explored the market and went to Platform 9 3/4 and back to Shoreditch for a quick dinner. After dinner we met up with Harry at a pub to watch the Belgium vs. England game. We moved to a second pub called Salmon and Ball and there was a hilarious heckler starting the most ridiculous chants (started 'Wonderwall' at one point) and when the Belgian goalie hit himself in the head with the ball as it bounced off the post he started the chant "You soft Belgian cunt." It was a riot.

**Friday, June 29**

In the evening, Anna and I met up with Harry and Nick at a spot called Nettlehouse 360--a cafe rooftop bar with hipster vibes. We picked up dinner at a spot called Bella Vita and had dinner and beers in the park. After dinner we went to the Dolphin, which is a great dive bar in Hockney--Anna and I sang "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" at karaoke there and hung out with thee boys until around midnight.
