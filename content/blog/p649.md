It was well curated, the space was well used and it was an interesting survey of one artist’s body of work, my issue with it was not liking specific pieces in the show rather than the show as a whole. Let me explain. I’m not a fan of his readymades, but I like the Banality Series and certain works from the Celebration Series. I also do not like the advertisement works from the \[\] series.
