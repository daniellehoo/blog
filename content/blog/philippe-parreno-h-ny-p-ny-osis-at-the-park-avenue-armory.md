Installation, light, video, performance and sound components all play into Philippe Parreno’s work filling the space at the Park Avenue Armory. It’s a completely immersive experience that is unique to each viewer (the exhibition will be at [the Armory through August 2](http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/philippe_parreno)) and I’d recommend giving yourself at least two hours if your goal is to watch all of the video art that comprises the installation. A cylindrical contraption, that acts as seating in the space, holds viewers and slowly rotates following the videos and the periodic light/sound pieces. Somewhat meta in nature due to the content of some videos, the piece really makes you contemplate your very own presence/placement within the exhibition.
