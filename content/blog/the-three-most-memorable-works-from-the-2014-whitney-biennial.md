While [Peter Schjeldahl](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2014/03/17/140317craw_artworld_schjeldahl) called this year’s Whitney Biennial a “frazzled, peculiarly melancholy Zeitgeist,” I think that label seems a bit too harsh. When assembling a comprehensive body of work that large how can one really avoid frazzledness? I think that it accomplished its aims–typifying contemporaneity and providing a semblance of “the art world today,” which is not an easy feat. The Biennial was curated according to floor, each one with a different curator and mission statement. I don’t think it was a coincident that all of my tops picks were from the same floor–the third floor curated by Stuart Comer whose attempt was to “provide a kaleidoscopic glimpse of this historic moment.” Comer utilized a variety of different mediums, styles, identities and tastes.

**Pick #1: Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, _Relationship Series_, 2008-2013. \[Pictured above\]** This beautiful series documents two transgendered individuals in a relationship while transitioning (in opposite directions) from one sex to another. The salon-hung pictures are visually captivating and offer an alluringly intimate portrayal into the lives of these lovers.

**Pick #2: Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, _Leviathan_, 2012** This very visceral work documents the North American fishing industry in 87-minutes of mesmerizing footage. I found myself sitting on the floor of this mini-theater for a good 20 minutes before I could pull myself away from the screen. I would love to watch the film in its entirety in another setting.

Bjarne Melgaard, _Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby_, 2014

**Pick #3: Bjarne Melgaard, _Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby_, 2014**  
It’s a room-sized installation complete with Skrillex pillows, half-naked mannequins, and an over-stimulating series of video and sound projections. I think that this room perfectly exemplifies what our lives have become as we become increasingly reliant on technology and the distractions that we coexist with as a product of our artificially created symbiotic relationship with inanimate objects.
