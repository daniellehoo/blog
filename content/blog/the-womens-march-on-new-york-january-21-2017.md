Estimates hover around 400,000 participants for the NYC faction of the Women’s March on DC, held last Saturday, January 21 in response to the Trump presidency’s implied message to women and targeted groups of people (i.e. the LGBTQ community, religious minorities, immigrants, etc.) A small group of friends met in Hell’s Kitchen to make signs and head to the march—which was entirely peaceful, orderly and absent of overbearing police presence. It was a small victory in the resistance movement and many more protests will be on the horizon during this administration—there’s one today in Battery Park to rally against the Muslim Ban Executive Order signed on Friday and there were several yesterday at airports around the country (JFK, SFO, LAX, ORD and Dulles) to protest the same—as many were being detained at airports after the order was signed.
