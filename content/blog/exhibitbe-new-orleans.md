My little brother, John, just graduated from Loyola University in New Orleans three weeks ago. Having been there three times now, I can honestly see myself moving there at some point. My one regret about this trip: (ok, two) I wish I saw more art (and took more time to scout out the galleries on Royal Street) and I wish I listened to more live music. John did take me to ExhibitBE–an amazing work of outdoor graffiti that covers unoccupied five-story buildings. Sort of what 5-Pointz was to Queens/Long Island City, ExhibitBE is to NoLA. A true celebration of street art–I present here, some of the highlights.
