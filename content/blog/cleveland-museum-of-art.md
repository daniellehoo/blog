</div>I was in Cleveland for a wedding over the fourth of July weekend (July 1–2) and went to the Cleveland Museum of Art on Sunday before flying back to New York. (Side note: American Airlines is terrible, our flight from Laguardia got cancelled and we had to drive seven hours through the night to get there). The collection covered antiquity through present and while their collection isn’t stellar (through they do have a holding of many large artists), I really enjoyed how the works are displayed, the flow of the museum, and the architecture of the building.
