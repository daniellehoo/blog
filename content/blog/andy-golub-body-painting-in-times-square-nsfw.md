Yesterday, while walking to meet a friend to see a Broadway show (tangent: we lost the lottery for Wicked tickets, but instead got student tickets to see [Romeo and Juliet](http://www.romeoandjulietbroadway.com/), now starring Orlando Bloom), I ran into body painter [Andy Golub](http://www.andygolub.com/) and about a dozen of his models. The models, along with Golub’s custom painted car, were part of a photo shoot and swarms of tourists/amateur photographers crowded around to snap some raunchy shots. Golub’s subjects ranged from young to elderly and slender to pudgy. Since there were so many people crowding around the front sides of the models, I was only able to capture the gang from the back (this may have been for the best).

The artist held another “show” in Times Square [back in July](http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/naked_models_take_over_times_square.php#photo-1), with only two models. One of his models was arrested in 2011 for public nudity and Golub has been arrested for charges of public lewdness. According to [New York penal code,](http://naturistaction.org/StatesFrames/State_Laws_Frames/New_York_Laws/body_new_york_laws.html) while public lewdness (“when someone intentionally exposes the private or intimate parts of his body in a lewd manner or commits any other lewd act (a) in a public place, or (b) in private premises under circumstances in which he may readily be observed from either a public place or from other private premises, and with intent that he be so observed”) is a class B misdemeanor, the “exposure of a person is “permitted in the event of breastfeeding of infants OR if any person is entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment.” Fun fact.
