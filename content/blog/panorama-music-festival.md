The above picture is from Day 3 of the Panorama Music Festival, taken during the Run the Jewels set. In a fraught time of immense political and racial turmoil, there’s nothing like a music festival to usher a bit of unity and a glimmer of hope. Former adamant Bernie supporter, Killer Mike and El-P offered the following during their set:

“Raise your hand if you know we’re gonna take this fuckin world back.” –El-P

“Take care of your fellow motherfucking citizens.” –Killer Mike

“Give a fuck about people who don’t look like us.” –Killer Mike
