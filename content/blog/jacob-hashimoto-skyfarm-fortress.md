_Skyfarm Fortress_, currently on view at Mary Boone in Chelsea, is a handmade sculpture made from wood, paper, and string. This is the East Coast counterpart to Hashimoto’s _Gas Giant,_ that open at LA MOCA’s Pacific Design Center in March 2014. Employing the artist’s signature bamboo and paper “kites” that play on his Japanese heritage, _Gas Giant_ offered an enveloping environment to explore.
