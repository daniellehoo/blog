On Saturday, I went to [Storm King Art Center](http://www.stormking.org/). It was chilly, but it was great fall weather for walking around the property. Currently (and through November 8) Lynda Benglisâ€™s *Water Sources* (seen below) is on display as a special exhibition. The works employ her emblematic, iconic materials of latex rubber and polyurethane foam.
