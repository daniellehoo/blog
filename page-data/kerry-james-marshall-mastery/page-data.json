Marshall’s works attempt to “counter stereotypical representations of black people in society and reassert the place of the black figure within the canon of Western painting.”\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 829px\">![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5349/30330684553_a0458a10fb_b.jpg)Still Life With Wedding Portrait, 2015\n</div>This exhibition runs concurrently with Kerry James Marshall Selects, curated by the artist (drawing works from The Met’s collection) and providing historical context for Marshall’s practice. Note The Met’s encyclopedia collection actually spans over 5,000 years. Rooting/positioning himself within these art historical parameters (bookends) solidified Marshall as a true ‘master’ of his craft.\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 752px\">![](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5812/30330683783_6996a9f9f7_b.jpg)SOB, SOB 2003\n</div>From the exhibition’s curator, Ian Alteveer: “Marshall’s work illustrates the American experience as unimaginable without black history and culture. Through the tropes of traditional painting—portraiture, landscape, and other narrative modes—he builds a conversation around visibility and invisibility. The result is a stunning body of work that is both intimate and monumental.”\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5599/30994082352_2040514879_b.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Marshall was born in pre-Civil Rights Act Birmingham, Alabama. His figures address ‘assertions of blackness’ in a medium where Africans and African Americans have been largely invisible. His style draws from comic books and muralist tradition, while his forms take the shape of the tableau, landscape and genre paintings.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 1610px\">![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5780/30330682793_fa7d495304_h.jpg)Campfire Girls, 1995\n</div>His works are poignant and compelling–in contemporary America they suddenly feel even more relevant.","frontmatter":{"title":"Kerry James Marshall: Mastery","date":"November 20, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/kerry-james-marshall-mastery/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/morocco/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Morocco"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/page_id917/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"portfolio"}}}}}
