When assembling a comprehensive body of work that large how can one really avoid frazzledness? I think that it accomplished its aims–typifying contemporaneity and providing a semblance of “the art world today,” which is not an easy feat. The Biennial was curated according to floor, each one with a different curator and mission statement. I don’t think it was a coincident that all of my tops picks were from the same floor–the third floor curated by Stuart Comer whose attempt was to “provide a kaleidoscopic glimpse of this historic moment.” Comer utilized a variety of different mediums, styles, identities and tastes.\n<p><strong>Pick #1: Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, <em>Relationship Series</em>, 2008-2013. [Pictured above]</strong> This beautiful series documents two transgendered individuals in a relationship while transitioning (in opposite directions) from one sex to another. The salon-hung pictures are visually captivating and offer an alluringly intimate portrayal into the lives of these lovers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\">![](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2922/14262129623_0de890ccef_z.jpg)Film Still from Leviathan\n</div>**Pick #2: Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, *Leviathan*, 2012** This very visceral work documents the North American fishing industry in 87-minutes of mesmerizing footage. I found myself sitting on the floor of this mini-theater for a good 20 minutes before I could pull myself away from the screen. I would love to watch the film in its entirety in another setting.\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 506px\">![](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14218889836_53e0a00b40_z.jpg \"Bjarne Melgaard, Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby, 2014\")Bjarne Melgaard, *Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby*, 2014\n</div>**Pick #3: Bjarne Melgaard, *Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby*, 2014**  \nIt’s a room-sized installation complete with Skrillex pillows, half-naked mannequins, and an over-stimulating series of video and sound projections. I think that this room perfectly exemplifies what our lives have become as we become increasingly reliant on technology and the distractions that we coexist with as a product of our artificially created symbiotic relationship with inanimate objects.","frontmatter":{"title":"The Three Most Memorable Works from The 2014 Whitney Biennial","date":"April 05, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-three-most-memorable-works-from-the-2014-whitney-biennial/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/mexico-city/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mexico City and Tulum"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/italian-futurism-at-the-guggenheim/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Italian Futurism at The Guggenheim"}}}}}
