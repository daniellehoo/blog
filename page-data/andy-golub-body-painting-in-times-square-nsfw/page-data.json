The models, along with Golub’s custom painted car, were part of a photo shoot and swarms of tourists/amateur photographers crowded around to snap some raunchy shots. Golub’s subjects ranged from young to elderly and slender to pudgy. Since there were so many people crowding around the front sides of the models, I was only able to capture the gang from the back (this may have been for the best).\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;\"> </span><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9616003111_ff2929f592_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p>The artist held another “show” in Times Square <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/naked_models_take_over_times_square.php#photo-1\">back in July</a>, with only two models.
