It features 24 weatherproof steel plates. Serra’s work is also featured as a permanent part of the Dia:Beacon collection. He is considered a minimalist artist (sculptor) and is known for his steels works that forcefully manipulate and contour the viewer’s body into a confined space. His background as a steel worker influenced his signature medium choice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/11914309074_425dd3733f_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Richard Serra, 7 Plates, 6 Angles, 2013, Weatherproof steel</p>\n<p>Also on display at the 555 gallery are <em>7 Plates, 6 Angles</em> (2013) (pictured above), G<em>rief and Reason (for Walter)</em>, (2013) (not pictured) for Walter De Maria, a close friend of Serra’s, who died this past July, and <em>Counterweights</em>, (2013) (not pictured).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/11914734646_5444780ea5_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Richard Serra, <em>Inside Out</em>, 2013, Weatherproof steel</p>\n<p>The space at the 522 gallery is dedicated to a single work made of curved, <em>Inside Out</em> (2013) (pictured above).
