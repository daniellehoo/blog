Currently there’s also a [Robert Indian exhibit (Beyond Love)](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/RobertIndiana) running though January 5, 2014 and a [T.J. Wilcox (In the Air) video instillation](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/TJWilcox) running through February 9, 2014 at the museum. My mother was ***very*** excited about seeing the Hopper exhibit before it closes on Sunday. The collection highlights the drawings and creative process of American realist painter and printmaker, Edward Hopper (1882-1967). Since we’re often viewing the final work products of painters, we tend to forget the work involved that goes into making a finished piece.\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 522px\">![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3767/10093221243_c447e31b95_z.jpg)Perkins Youngboy Dos Passos, 1941, Fabricated chalk on paper\n</div>The following drawing and painting series reminds me of Vista Market in Pound Ridge, NY.\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 443px\">![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/10093114634_34ec0eaef5_z.jpg)Study for Gas, 1940, Fabricated chalk on paper\n</div><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 522px\">![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7381/10093175266_64c1b4b351_z.jpg)Study for Gas, 1940, Charcoal and white chalk with graphite pencil on paper\n</div><div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\">![](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2889/10093150275_76e6d8c9fc_z.jpg)Gas, 1940, Oil on canvas\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hopper Drawings at The Whitney","date":"October 05, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hopper-drawings-at-the-whitney/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-philip-johnson-glass-house/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Philip Johnson Glass House"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/deville-cohen-studio-visit/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deville Cohen: Studio Visit"}}}}}
