Having been there three times now, I can honestly see myself moving there at some point. My one regret about this trip: (ok, two) I wish I saw more art (and took more time to scout out the galleries on Royal Street) and I wish I listened to more live music. John did take me to ExhibitBE–an amazing work of outdoor graffiti that covers unoccupied five-story buildings. Sort of what 5-Pointz was to Queens/Long Island City, ExhibitBE is to NoLA. A true celebration of street art–I present here, some of the highlights.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7770/18214958805_8baa6663c5_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7748/18214959615_2267512d2c_z.jpg\" alt=\"n5\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7733/18214961725_21773e27b6_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8894/17594357313_46c9faab50_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8773/17592338024_ac8ba3c0b9_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8832/18216187171_272c693f2d_z.jpg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ExhibitBE: New Orleans","date":"May 29, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/exhibitbe-new-orleans/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/mathieu-mericer-diamants-2015-at-moynihan-station/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mathieu Mericer: Diamants 2015 at Moynihan Station"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/life-of-cats-selections-from-the-hiraki-ukiyo-e-collection-at-the-japan-society/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection at the Japan Society"}}}}}
