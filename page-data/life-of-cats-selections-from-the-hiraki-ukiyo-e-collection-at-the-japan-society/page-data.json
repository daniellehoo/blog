He’s a black cat and his name is Cesare after Cesare Borgia. Naturally, I’m a cat (and overall, an animal) lover and this exhibition, brought to my attention by a fellow Sotheby’s alum, clearly appealed to my interests. The selection of (mostly) Edo woodblock prints were whimsical and combined myth and folklore with history and culture.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.japansociety.org/event/life-of-cats-selections-from-the-hiraki-ukiyo-e-collection\">Japan Society’s</a> press release:</p>\n<p>“Since arriving in Japan aboard Japanese ships transporting sacred Buddhist scriptures from China in the mid-sixth century, cats have proceeded to purr and paw their way into the heart of Japanese life, folklore, and art. <em>Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection</em> illustrates the depth of this mutual attraction by mining the wealth of bravura depictions of cats to be found in ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the Edo Period (1615-1867). The exhibition is divided into five sections: Cats and People, Cats as People, Cats versus People, Cats Transformed and Cats and Play. 90 ukiyo-e prints in the exhibition are on loan from the esteemed Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation whose holdings are revered in Japan. Select prints, paintings, sculptures, and other works borrowed from U.S. collections complement these prints, making the exhibition over 120 artworks. With cross-cultural and multi-generational appeal, <em>Life of Cats</em> takes viewers on a wild ride through Japan’s love affair with our feline friends.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7701/17108346620_2cda6bfc41_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7695/17295910415_2681027d4a_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7681/17294073312_4675d1109b_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8701/16675657633_ed115ab1f0_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p>This exhibition will run through June 7, 2015.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection at the Japan Society","date":"April 28, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/life-of-cats-selections-from-the-hiraki-ukiyo-e-collection-at-the-japan-society/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/exhibitbe-new-orleans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ExhibitBE: New Orleans"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/armory-arts-week-volta-highlights/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Armory Arts Week: Volta Highlights"}}}}}
