I also had the opportunity to attend Frieze, which was great, but a lot of the same old galleries producing their standard fare (with some exceptions and while I appreciated their initiatives to be interactive Gagosian producing Richard Prince’s Instagram prints and selling them for $100,000 a piece doesn’t really do it for me). So–the gallery I am currently doing a bit of freelancing/consulting for–Denis Gardarin Gallery–put on an exhibition from May 13-16. The show displayed 7 of French conceptual artist Mathieu Mercier’s paintings “Diamants,” which, close-up appear to be abstract, but from far away look like diamonds. They really fit well into the old post office space and the evening light during the opening was absolutely fabulous.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 490px\">![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8874/18211988952_ce79ba3742_z.jpg)Me and Denis\n</div>![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8797/18189184086_08b30ccbf7_z.jpg)\n<p><img src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7761/18027917820_0af3f49fb6_z.jpg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mathieu Mericer: Diamants 2015 at Moynihan Station","date":"May 29, 2015"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mathieu-mericer-diamants-2015-at-moynihan-station/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/exhibitbe-new-orleans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ExhibitBE: New Orleans"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/philippe-parreno-h-ny-p-ny-osis-at-the-park-avenue-armory/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Philippe Parreno H {N)Y P N(Y} OSIS at the Park Avenue Armory"}}}}}
