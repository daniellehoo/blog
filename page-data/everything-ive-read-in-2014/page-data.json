The Lonely Polygamist by Brady Udall</strong><br>\nA fictional chronicle of one man’s breakdown with the background noise of 4 wives and 28 kids.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/0/573/2307500/Object%20of%20Beauty_1.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>2. An Object of Beauty by Steve Martin</strong><br>\nA novel about one young woman’s grooming at Sotheby’s and subsequent art world ladder climbing in New York City.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M-rPSHLlL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>3. Just Kids by Patti Smith</strong><br>\nA pretty emotional read. Patti Smith’s firsthand account of her relationship and friendship with Robert Maplethorpe through his battle with AIDS and their struggle in New York City and life at the Chelsea Hotel in the late 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nktefAZTL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>4. Seven Days in the Art World by Sarah Thornton</strong><br>\nA similar read to the $12 Million Stuffed Shark by Don Thompson, though a bit outdated (published in 2008), this book outlines the basics of the contemporary art world–from fairs to collectors to the secondary market.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://sorrytelevision.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/527141df7cd2b-preview-300.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>5. The Goldfinch</strong> Though a bit of a long read, an excellent and emotional contemporary coming of age tale taking place mostly in New York City.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loveundetectable_sullivan.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>6. Love Undetectable</strong><br>\nThe book’s author, Andrew Sullivan, an HIV positive homosexual writing with Christian perspectives and ideals in mind, employs the use of three separate essays to discuss love, relationships and friendship. For me, despite the religious discussion throughout, the overall message still resonated. Best take home message: Romantic love is possible because of friendship, which tends to be more stable with the former having a larger tendency to be in flux.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IAY-aH-ZL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>7. Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet by Sidney D. Kirkpatrick</strong> This one is a bit out there, but a man I talked to on a flight back in June from JFK to Milan recommended this (and a whole list of books on theosophy) to me. It’s a fantastic biography about the life and work of Edgar Cayce, who was a psychic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the ability to answer questions about reincarnation, healing and other topics while in trance. An interesting read, but it drags a bit at times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e6/45/2f/e6452f51e978c702f90fa5c7812ef1ec.jpg\"><br>\n<strong>8. Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</strong> Someone at a Bushwich open studios party recommended this one to me. Great coming of age novel about a young non-American black woman and her struggle with the issue of race. It’s also a love story, but that’s definitely secondary to other more over-arching themes in the book.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Everything I Have Read in 2014","date":"December 31, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/everything-ive-read-in-2014/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hong-kong/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hong Kong"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/zero-countdown-to-tomorrow-1950s-60s/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ZERO: Countdown to Tomorrow, 1950s–60s"}}}}}
