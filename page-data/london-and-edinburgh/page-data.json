That night Anna and I went to Queen of Hoxton in Shoreditch.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturday, June 23</strong></p>\n<p>Met up with my friend Joe (who I met 5 years prior in Croatia) and we all went to the Museum of Natural History. I also got a consultation at Good Times tattoo (but ultimately chickened out and didn’t get it). Then Joe and I went to Old St. Records, another pub, and The Magic Roundabout (we drew pen tattoos on each other). We had dinner at an Indian spot on Brick Lane. He missed the last train to his town out of London and ended up sleeping at the station. We also saw someone who was possibly stabbed and walked streets littered with metal nitrous pods.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunday, June 24</strong></p>\n<p>I met up with my friend Harry who I met in Thailand, his sister Michaela, his friend visiting from Melbourne, Nick, and their other friend Timmy. We watched thee England/Panama World Cup game (England won 6–1) and then went to the park in Hackney near where Harry lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Monday, June 25</strong></p>\n<p>Met up with Nick to go to the British Museum. We managed to cover most of the museum, got coffee, grabbed a bear, and then headed to. Shoreditch to have dinner for Harry’s birthday at Flat Iron (a steak spot). Afterwards we watched some of the Iran vs. Portugal game at The Enchanted Garden.</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday, June 26</strong></p>\n<p>Met up with Nick to go to the London Museum and then got coffee in a park.</p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday, June 27</strong></p>\n<p>Went to the National Gallery solo. Got sick.</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday, June 28</strong></p>\n<p>Met up with Nick again to go to Camden—we explored the market and went to Platform 9 3/4 and back to Shoreditch for a quick dinner. After dinner we met up with Harry at a pub to watch the Belgium vs. England game. We moved to a second pub called Salmon and Ball and there was a hilarious heckler starting the most ridiculous chants (started ‘Wonderwall’ at one point) and when the Belgian goalie hit himself in the head with the ball as it bounced off the post he started the chant “You soft Belgian cunt.” It was a riot.</p>\n<p><strong>Friday, June 29</strong></p>\n<p>In the evening, Anna and I met up with Harry and Nick at a spot called <a href=\"https://netil360.com/\" title=\"Nettlehouse 360\">Nettlehouse 360</a>—a cafe rooftop bar with hipster vibes. We picked up dinner at a spot called Bella Vita and had dinner and beers in the park. After dinner we went to the Dolphin, which is a great dive bar in Hockney—Anna and I sang “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” at karaoke there and hung out with the boys until around midnight.</p>\n<p><strong>Saturday, June 30</strong></p>\n<p>Anna and I went to the Victoria and Albert (V&#x26;A) Design Museum to see the Frida Kahlo exhibition, but it was sold out so we just viewed the permanent collection complete with costume/fashion—it’s quite an impressive building. </p>\n<p>In the evening, I met up with Harry and Nick and we went to The Alibi in Dalston (which has since closed and reflects a change to the east London club scene brought on by Hackney licensing laws). We danced for quite a while—the bar was a great little hole in the wall establishment. After the Alibi closed we headed to the Dolphin to finish the night out until 4:00 am (a delayed celebration of Harry’s birthday). The sun was coming up when we left and I followed the boys back to Harry’s flat where we continued to talk and hang out in Harry’s yard until the really wee hours in the morning—listening to music and chain smoking cigarettes. </p>\n<p><strong>Sunday, July 1</strong></p>\n<p>We woke up at 1:30 p.m. Harry grilled sausages and we had salad while Adam (Harry’s brother) and Nick watched an Australia Football League (AFL) or ‘footy’ game on the tube. I made my way back to Anna’s and after a shower and a nap we had dinner at East Street (the Asian spot downstairs from her flat). We planned out our trip to Scotland for the following weekend and called it a night.</p>\n<p><strong>Monday, July 2</strong></p>\n<p>This was Nick’s last day in London before heading to Greece, Spain, and Portugal. We met up near next to the National Portrait Gallery and then went to grab a coffee (he has my order of an Americano with almond milk down) and then we got a pint and some fish and chips at Sherlock Holmes pub. I walked him to his tube stop with the parting words “If you’re ever in Melbourne!”</p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday, July 3</strong></p>\n<p>I worked on a coding assignment for a job I was in the process of applying for and then in the afternoon went to St. Paul’s (just’s the exterior) an Tate Modern solo. I bought a bunch of books (including Noam Chomsky on Palestine) and spent a good portion of time in the book shop. While checkout out, I chatted with the shopkeeper about my visit to Palestine. Exploring the city without Nick was a little sad since we were London buddies and had established a habit of hanging out everyday.
