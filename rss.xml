&lt;p&gt;Great Ocean Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, I went on a one-month backpacking trip around Western Europe with my roommate from college. We went to Ireland, France, Spain, and Italy. In Paris we stayed in a really shitty hostel that actually smelled like piss. The silver lining was that we met Tom and Liv, two Aussies from Melbourne. In Paris, Tom ate his first crêpe and we all went to the Centre Pompidou together on a super grey day. Fast forward to 2013 and then 2015 when Tom was traveling the globe again and came to stay with me in New York. The offer to visit Australia always stood, the circumstances just had to align—I happened to have a bit of time off because I recently quit my job, so my friend Kay-Lin and I booked a trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4654/38830723200_84f110334d.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captured in Fitzroy, Melbourne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it all went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4702/40599509212_be845ec91e.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, February 5–Tuesday, February 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our Qantas flight from JFK departed at 6:00 p.m. We had a layover at LAX and were in transit for about 24 hours. On the LAX to MEL leg (15.5 hours), the band &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq-T49MqRiQ&quot;&gt;Unwritten Law&lt;/a&gt; sits in the row in front of us en route to their Australia tour (&lt;em&gt;note: we were in the back of coach in a row in the 60s&lt;/em&gt;). I watched &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Seven Year Itch&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bladerunner: 2049.&lt;/em&gt; Tangent: I forgot how damn good &lt;em&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4609/26769273658_977f64906e.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside NGV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We arrive at the Melbourne airport where Tom picks us up. (Victoria and New South Wales are 16-hours ahead of New York). We get settled at his house in the suburbs of Ivanhoe. We meet the pups Bosco and Yoda, Tom goes into work, and after a proper shower get lunch at a place called Caffe Strada (&lt;em&gt;note, things we quickly learned: the Aussies love their avocado aka “avo” toast, their abbreviations, and you have to go up to the counter to pay the check, even at more upscale restaurants&lt;/em&gt;). For dinner, we met up with Tom, Liv, Tom’s gf Lisa at a place called Ha Long Bay in Little Vietnam (there’s no shortage of good Asia cuisine in Oz).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4797/40640914001_0c8ecfe62b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Library of Victoria&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, February 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We wake up pretty early to explore downtown Melbourne. First, we visited the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/&quot;&gt;NGA (National Gallery of Victoria)&lt;/a&gt; at their contemporary/international location to see their Triennial, which was quite good. After the museum, we got lunch and saw the State Library of Victoria, which is a wonderful building. Then we tried to go to the Queen Victoria Market, but it closed at 2:00 p.m. so we walked through the empty stalls. Next, we went to the domestic/indigenous portion of NGA before visiting Hosier Lane to see street art and Degraves Street for little shops and such. After, we headed to Fitzroy (the Brooklyn of Melbourne) for a bit of wandering and dinner at a Greek place called Alpha Guzeri. Our waiter was very friendly and gave us written directions back to Ivanhoe. Aussies are really the friendliest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4710/40640910411_2693bef484.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve Apostles, Great Ocean Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, February 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After getting breakfast at a Tulip Coffee on Degraves Street (and talking to one of the workers who was an American from Colorado by way of West Virginia), we met up with some of out tour group for the Great Ocean Road tour outside of the Immigration Museum. We met a bloke named Rasmus from outside of Stockholm who was in construction and on holiday indefinitely. Our guide’s name was Peter and there were 23 people total on the tour (from New Zealand, Germany, South Africa, India, and the UK). The tour started with tea at Urquhart Bluff and then we stopped at the Memorial Arch for photos. We passed through Lorne, stopped to see koalas at Kennett River, had lunch at the Iluka Restaurant in Apollo Bay, walked through Maits Rest Rainforest, and then Port Campbell Park to see the 12 Apostles. We took a walk on the beach at Loch Arch gorge and saw the fallen London Bridge. We didn’t get back to Melbourne until 9:30 p.m. and we grabbed a quick dinner on Degraves again at a great burger chain called Grill’d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4747/40640909361_75abc44626.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brighton Beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, February 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tom, Lisa, Kay-Lin and I had brunch at an amazing placed called Friends of Mine. We then went to Brighton Beach to see the beach boxes (after quickly stopping by Tom’s office). After that we went back to Tom’s place and Kay-Lin and I went into town to do some shopping (but to our dismay, basically everything closes at around 2:00 p.m. on Saturday). For dinner, we went to the Moroccan Soup Bar, an incredible family-style place in Fitzroy North. Then we went to St. Kilda’s to see the penguins at sunset.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4778/40640912391_b664c93cd4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street art in Fitzroy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, February 11&lt;/strong&gt; While Lisa and Kay-Lin went to yoga, Tom and I ran 10 miles with Bosco (he’s a Kelpie, possibly dingo mix) on the Yarra River Trail. It started to rain at the end, but it was warm and the trail was great—we saw horses and got to run alongside the river (albeit the river is this sort of mossy green color). We all had lunch at a great vegetarian place called Trippy Taco (yes, in Fitzroy). Kay-Lin and I went on to check out the St. Kilda Festival (“Australis’s largest, free festival!”) on the beach and saw the set of an Australian, Tkay Maidza on the main stage. It was gorgeous weather. Dinner was at Thornbury—a little food truck park with a bar. I had a burger from a truck called Mr. Burger and after dinner got ice cream from Fairy Hills near Tom’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4703/40640911131_e01106f013.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the Great Ocean Road&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, February 12&lt;/strong&gt; We (sadly) departed Melbourne for Proserpine (a tiny airport outside of Airlie Beach). We stayed here one night before our sailing trip and went to the local beach and had dinner at a place called D’Viet House. The food in Airlie Beach left a lot to be desired, especially after being spoiled in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4741/39745018515_607f8532fb.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboard the Waltzing Matilda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We had to be at the dock at 8:00 a.m. to board the Waltzing Matilda—our sailboat. The crew was Captain Paul, an Aussie who used to be in construction, and Noel (&lt;em&gt;Noelle)&lt;/em&gt; from California. Our first stop was Hook Island/inlet. After an intro and welcome tea, we went to False Nara for snorkeling (we had to wear stinger suits on account of the jelly fish that reside in the waters). After that we snorkeled in Saba where we was a turtle. Then we had lunch and we had our last snorkel of the day at Hook Passage. Then we had dinner and watched the stars—the sky was so clear. We docked for the night at Hook Passage. Our shipmates included a Chinese family of five, two Swiss girls, a German girl, a German man and girl traveling together, and a couple from the UK/Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4621/25770050177_930c1618d8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitehaven Beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We woke up at around 6:00 a.m. to the sound of the engine. We ate a bit of breakfast and headed for Tongue Bay (Captain Paul called it ‘Shit Beach’) for a tiny bit of hiking and a visit to Whitehaven Beach (one of the top 10 beaches in the world). We had to wear the stinger suits for the beach as well. We spent about two hours in the beach and sailed back to Airlie Beach. After a nap we had a very mediocre (Valentine’s) pizza dinner at The Deck across from our hostel. The hostel (Magnum’s) was under construction and was an indoor/outdoor situation with heavy backpacker vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4617/39745697795_efc69ecf64.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haters will say it’s Photoshopped&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, February 15&lt;/strong&gt; Another bright and early wake up for a 6:00 a.m. SKY DIVING call time at Airlie Beach sky diving over the Whitsundays. It’s a pretty surreal bucket list thing and after it happens, watching the video you feel like you’re witnessing someone else’s experience. In the late afternoon, we took a yoga class at Yartamana Yoga. For lunch, we had snacks from Woolworth’s and for dinner we had fish &amp;#x26; chips from Whitsunday Seafood. We tried to venture to check out the nightlife scene and walked to a nightclub called Boom, but weren’t really feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4783/40598805892_66f1c94d05.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sydney Harbor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, February 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We flew from Proserpine to Sydney and checked into our hostel Wake Up! Sydney, centrally located near the main train station. We met up with our (American) from Tom for dinner in Chinatown (it was the first night of Chinese New Year) and ate at Emperor’s Garden where a lion dancer came and collected lucky money. We had Cantonese fried rice, vegetables, and fried beef. After dinner, we walked around the harbor, which was decorated for Chinese New Year—the city invited artists to depict all 12 Chinese Zodiac signs. It was my first time seeing the opera house in person and pictures don’t prepare you for what a marvel that building actually is. We got bubble tea from Gong Cha before parting ways and heading to back to our hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4662/40598804492_d09b93f8d2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katarina Grosse at Carrigeworks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, February 17&lt;/strong&gt; In the morning, I went for a 6 mile run to the harbor, which had amazing views of the opera house. The city is so incredibly hilly. We met Tom for brunch at The Gardens and then we went to The Museum of Contemporary Art to see Pipilotti Rist, Sip My Ocean, which was previously on view at The New Museum in New York (it was ok). Then we went to Carriageworks (an industrial event space with a bar inside that had Pioneer Works vibes) to see Katharina Grosse. After that we explored Newtown and had a bite to eat at Milk Bar (no Momofuku affiliation). We went home for what was supposed to be a nap before going out, but it ended up being the end of the night so we just stopped at Woolworth’s for a snack and hit up Gong Cha again for some bubble tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4779/38831343250_cc60d03582.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondi Beach cliff walk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, February 18&lt;/strong&gt; In the morning, we headed to North Bondi to meet Tom and had brunch at this amazing Israeli place called Shuk. After brunch, we went to the beach and walked along the cliff walk from Bondi to Tamarama to Bronte, where we settled for a nap. We rode the bus back to the train station (stopped for a bubble tea at Teascoo) and headed to our hostel. We then met Tom for dinner in Spice Alley and had Singaporean food from Alex Lee. We attempted to go out to redeem ourselves, but a lot of bars are closed on Sundays. We had a few beers at Side Bar (attached to our hostel) and called it a night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4656/40598803372_e7347d54ae.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin the koala&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, February 19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We grabbed a quick breakfast at Ray’s Cafe (in our hostel) and met Tom to go to the Taronga Zoo. I fault myself for forgetting how sad zoos can be (and why I never go to them), but we rode the ferry there and got to experience the koala encounter where we got to get close to (but not touch) a koala named Darwin. Apparently it’s only legal to hold a koala in Queensland. The zoo is massive (and hilly) and the chimps were super sad. After getting back, we took pictures of the opera house, walked around Chinatown and had dinner at Tim Ho Wan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4774/40598801252_3caaf7045f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue Mountains&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 20&lt;/strong&gt; On our last day, we went on a tour through the Blue Mountains (we booked through Loka). Our tour guide’s name was Cameron and he was wonderful. First we stopped in Euroka to see Eastern Grey Kangaroos (tour guide Cameron told us that there are 5 million people in Sydney, 25 million people in Australia and 26 million kangaroos). Next we stopped for brekkie in a town called Glenbrook, then we hiked for 1.5 hours to Wentworth Falls and had lunch, after we walked the Prince Henry Cliff walk to see the Three Sisters and we ended at Lincoln’s Rock for views. After we got back, we had dinner in Spice Alley again, got Gong Cha and checked out a bar called the Soda Factory (you have to literally go through a ‘Coca Cola’ machine to get in). It was a cute, albeit kitschy place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4665/38830711410_c6a91753a4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sydney Opera House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, February 21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We trekked to the airport for our flight home (with another layover in LAX). On the first leg, I watched &lt;em&gt;Young Victoria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Zookeepers Wife, and Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami.&lt;/em&gt; And so, I return to Brooklyn with a renewed travel itch. Next time I visit Oz, I’ll have to see Tasmania, the West Coast, and Northern and Southern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PopRally x Items: BOOTLEGGED]]></title><description><![CDATA[Party-goers make custom bandanas, photo by Alycia Kravitz As a last symphony of sorts before I quit my job at MoMA, I was on the key…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/poprally-x-items-bootlegged/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/poprally-x-items-bootlegged/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2018 01:19:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4710/26594622978_a3081656c8.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last symphony of sorts before I quit my job at MoMA, I was on the key organizers of the event &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/4007?locale=en&quot;&gt;PopRally x Items: BOOTLEGGED&lt;/a&gt;. The event honored the bootleg in fashion in celebration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/calendar/exhibitions/1638&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Items: Is Fashion Modern?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MoMA’s first fashion exhibition in over 70 years, which closed on January 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebration featured a DJ set by the legendary DJ duo &lt;a href=&quot;http://stretchandbobbito.com/&quot;&gt;Stretch &amp;#x26; Bobbito&lt;/a&gt;, art-making, drinks, and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event featured original bootleg interpretations of the iconic MoMA logo on selected objects represented in the exhibition, by artists Kamoni Chandler aka A$AP K, Awol Erizku, Ava Nirui, and Mackenzie Younger. Guests were given the opportunity to show up wearing their favorite of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/items/items-is-fashion-modern-checklist-e353b83e7652&quot;&gt;111 items&lt;/a&gt; featured in the exhibition for an opportunity to walk away with one of the exclusive limited-edition artist bootlegs.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you were able to find the silver lining and the year brought you long sought solace. Either way, the calendar year is over after an overwhelming amount of calamity and head and heartache, 2018 is at our collective doorstep. New Years make me hopeful and they’re a fresh start, so hooray for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s everything I read this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4739/24572673857_ecb27b5c21.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt; was my first foray into Murakami. I went in wanting to love it, but didn’t emerge from the experience wholly satisfied. I’m glad that I gave his work another chance because &lt;em&gt;Kafka on the Shore&lt;/em&gt; was entertaining and enjoyable from cover to cover and filled with taking cats, oedipal prophecies, and mysticism. Murakami is a wonderful storyteller, the narrative is compelling and there is solid character development. It has all of the makings of a top-notch novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4593/24572668627_6e3f81efbd.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Consider the Lobster by David Foster Wallace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinite Jest&lt;/em&gt; is still on my to-do list. It may always remain there, but in the meantime I still enjoy (and sometimes struggle with) DFW’s dense, writing style–filled with footnotes (he loves footnotes), self-awareness and a sometimes irritating level of detail. &lt;em&gt;Consider the Lobster&lt;/em&gt; is a book of his essays. My favorite from the collection is one titled “Up Simba” where he writes about John McCain’s 2000 presidential campaign and riding the bus called “The Straight Talk Express” while researching for the original article published in the April 2000 issue of &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone.&lt;/em&gt; This year maverick McCain made a lot of headlines//received a lot of press coverage standing up to the Trump agenda and because of his brain cancer diagnosis (and also due to the latter while also conducting the former). “Up Simba” gives an amazingly detailed account of McCain’s time spend as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War (another topic that was made highly relevant in 2017 with the release of Ken Burns &amp;#x26; Lynn Novick’s incredible PBS documentary film on the topic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4682/24572668507_b93690b831.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another novel incorporating the talking cat motif. I would be lying if the talking black cat wasn’t at least partially a pull here for me. This one is a classic and I’m trying to slowly catch up on my Russian literature (I think one novel from the genre/year is sufficient because they’re always such downers). The novel combines two parts–one set in ancient Jerusalem (a city that has personal relevance for me this year and that’s received even more global attention than usual as of late) and one in contemporary Moscow. The devil visits Moscow (an atheist state, under Stalin’s rule) with a vodka and chess-loving black cat, while the plot of Pontius Pilate plays out in what later emerges as a novel (written by a writer, known as the Master). The Master’s mistress, Margarita is tempted by the devil. This one is a surreal dark comedy that will force your mind though existential hoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4679/38730924994_2bd05eebc3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a post-colonial classic (that also ventures into pre-colonial life) in late nineteenth century Nigeria. I never had to read it in school (like many did), but I enjoyed it in adulthood–from the descriptions of patriarchal tribal native customs to the heavy blows of British colonialism and Christian missionaries on one man’s (Okonkwo) life and on the Igbo community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4593/38730924774_aa5903ba6b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Strangers in Their Own Land by Arlie Russell Hochschild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book recommendation from a close friend was the perfect dovetail from J.D. Vance’s &lt;em&gt;Hillbilly Elegy.&lt;/em&gt; After scrambling to answer ‘How did [Trump’s election] happen?’ in late 2016 into early 2017, we [woke folks in America] found ourselves voraciously reading anything we could get our hands on to explain this all away. Hochschild is a Berkley sociologist (it’s not as bad as it may sound) interested in how people on the right think. She spent five years in Louisiana talking with people on the other side of her “empathy wall.” (Defined as an obstacle that prevents a deep understanding with another person). She picked the state because it ranks 49th in ‘human development’ and extremely low in overall heath, education and child well-being, yet its citizens mostly spurn federal help. Despite the environmental concerns that local industry poses, they are also extremely anti-government regulation. The simplified logic behind it all is more oil = more jobs = more prosperity and less need for government. It’s a fascinating look at a small pocket of America until a microscope–in a slightly different vein from Vance’s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4599/24572670117_af4d4329fc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of a friend I met at a party recommended this one when I mentioned that I loved the Elena Ferrante novels. It’s not fair to call it a trashy beach read, because it warrants more praise and merit than that, but I would group it in the same category as the Ferrante books. It’s a love story at its core, taking place in the 1960s on the coast of the Ligurian Sea. An Italian innkeeper meets an American actress and what ensues is a story outlined over the course of fifty years. It’s hopeful and gripping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4736/38730926454_31456e1057.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Acid Test by Tom Shroder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this book on a ‘leave a book, take a book’ shelf in a Moroccan hotel in the fall of 2016. The subject matter piqued my interest and though the narratives were a bit hard to follow at times, it does a good job outlining successful case studies where individuals with PTSD used controlled amounts of psychedelic drugs to help their psyche. Overly regulated and wildly cast as illegal and dangerous, these drugs have true healing properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4682/38730926714_73b0d53134.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a commencement speech in May where Walter Isaacson was the keynote. It was a really wonderful speech and Isaacson quoted job a lot–because he spent so much time with him after Jobs persistently requested that Isaacson be his personal biographer after Jobs knew his cancer case was terminal. Isaacson is an incredible biographer and he interviewed over 100 of those close to Jobs for this book. He also made a point to seek out all angles of the story–he interviewed his loved ones as well as people who Jobs screwed over in business. The book also outlines (in great detail) the entire trajectory of Apple, from an idea Jobs had with Steve Wozniak (“Woz”) to Steve breaking off to form NeXT, to ripping off Xerox’s technology to present day. Jobs insisted that the masses were too stupid to know what they wanted and had to be told (he was against market research and what’s today known as user experience design), but still ultimately knew exactly to deliver a product that would succeed. He was heavily influenced by the Bauhaus and insisted on rounded corners. He was also vehemently against the stylus and it’s my personal opinion that he’s rolling in his grave over the Apple pencil. This was definitely my top read of the year and Jobs’ complicated backstory and fascinating mind are described so well in this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4727/38730926774_90f01f8f7b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Swing Time by Zadie Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Zadie Smith book, and perhaps I should have started elsewhere. The story jumps between London and West Africa, and switches between the past and present to tell the story of friendship between two brown girls, and their respective hardships through the lens of competitive dance. The plot was lacking, but again sort of reminiscent of the Ferrante novels in the way that they outline the antagonistic aspect of female friendship and coming of age. Despite this experience I still want to read &lt;em&gt;White Teeth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4739/24572670407_c3233b0135.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. The Inner Sky by Steven Forrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research into what a good first read on astrology would be, since I wanted to learn a bit more about signs and such. This was a pretty good introduction covering the planet, the signs, houses, and aspects. It also includes a chapter on how to interpret charts. I’ll need to follow it up with something that goes more in-depth, since there are still a lot of gaps in my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4734/24572670277_e0d8bcf8e9.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. A Gambler’s Anatomy by Jonathan Latham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a big fan of Lethem’s 2003 &lt;em&gt;Fortress of Solitude&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-autobiographical coming of age tale of growing up motherless in a gentrifying Brooklyn in the 1970s (through the 1990s). &lt;em&gt;A Gambler’s Anatomy&lt;/em&gt; is about a backgammon gambler, Bruno Alexander, winning money from rich folks who think they can challenge his peerless game. A pesky blot eventually blurs his vision and has graver implications for the once-psychic protagonist. A weird read, for sure–but it’s certainly worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4680/38730926864_cb5cebf778.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Sapiens, A Brief History of Human King by Yuval Noah Harari&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always see people reading this one on the subway and a friend mentioned she was reading this over the summer. It harps on the premise that 100,000 years ago there were at least six human special inhabiting earth and today there is just one: us, homo sapiens. The book outlines scenarios for how we succeeded to dominate and why our foraging ancestors came together to create cities and kingdoms, how we came to believe in human rights, to trust the system of money and to become enslaved by systems of bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism. How will our species progress (or not) into the future millennia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4727/38730926934_64ca08d666.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;freeText4649314682690466599&quot;&gt;  
&lt;/span&gt;**13. Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramhansa Yogananda**
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the Steve Jobs bio, Jobs, shaped largely by a trip to India in his youth and his Buddhist ideals, read this particular title one a year. I didn’t quite understand the pull after reading it myself–the author comes off as pompous and does a subpar job detailing his life and an even worse job outlining his system of beliefs. I did make a friend on the subway who asked me about the title and proceeded to give me her card and invite me to her poetry reading. I still fail to understand why this is considered a classic in spiritual literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4682/24572670157_4c943aab21.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Moonglow by Michael Chabon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first Chabon novel. When I was reading this on the subway, a man stopped me and told me that &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp;#x26; Clay&lt;/em&gt; is his favorite book and I have to read that one too. &lt;em&gt;Moonglow&lt;/em&gt; was inspired by Chabon’s grandfather’s deathbed confessions while he’s on painkillers. From pre-war South Philly to Germany to a Florida retirement home, to a prison in New York, the novel collapses one man’s life into a week. As Goodreads puts it, it’s “&lt;span id=&quot;freeText3345685399332595511&quot;&gt;a work of fictional non-fiction, an autobiography wrapped in a novel disguised as a memoir, &lt;em&gt;Moonglow&lt;/em&gt; is Chabon at his most daring, his most moving, his most Chabonesque.” While I enjoyed it, and this problem may be mine, but I had a hard time following the story in some spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4643/38730926394_31cb214012.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. In the Shadows of the American Century by Alfred McCoy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself asking why did I choose to end the year reading this particular book? I read an excerpt from the author on Brain Pickings and was inspired to order it from Amazon. Ending the year with a downer book isn’t necessarily a bad thing: sure, I’ve got different scenarios for the end of the world playing through my head, but the scariest part is that all of these are not too far from reality. Maybe it’ll somehow make me more optimistic in 2018, but I’m almost afraid to ask myself ‘how much worse could things get?’ The end of the book really forces you to put on your tin foil hat while McCoy takes you through five possible scenarios for the demise of the empire of the United States of America. As we all know by now, Trump is not the cause of the downfall, he is merely a symptom of it. By 2030/2040 it looks like China will surely be on top and it’s largely unclear what the role of the States will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remain hopeful for 2018. Happy New Year y’all!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Toyin Ojih Odutola "To Wander Determined" at The Whitney]]></title><description><![CDATA[Toyin Ojih Odutola, Birmingham (Left) A Nigerian colleague of mine first put Toyin Ojih Odutola on my radar about a year or so ago.

&lt;p&gt;Toyin Ojih Odutola, Birmingham (Left)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nigerian colleague of mine first put Toyin Ojih Odutola on my radar about a year or so ago. The artist was born in Nigeria and came the States with her family at age five, grew up in Huntsville, Alabama and is now based in New York. Originally known for her textural pen drawings depicting and investigating “what skin feels like,” these works gave skin an almost fur-like quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4536/38730234791_3669a293ee_c.jpg&quot;&gt;Toyin Ojih Odutola, Newlyweds On Holiday, 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her current solo exhibition at the Whitney (her first solo show in New York) titled &lt;em&gt;To Wander Determined&lt;/em&gt;, Ojih Odutola stages a series of fictional portraits detailing the lives of two aristocratic, Lagos-based, Nigerian families. For the artist, these images serve to correct the ‘Eurocentric art history’ where portraiture is overwhelmingly white and black characters are footnotes cast in secondary roles or left out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/4560/38730225551_34ae51b277_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyin Ojih Odutola, Unclaimed Estates, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyin Ojih Odutola: To Wander Determined&lt;/em&gt; presents a new body of work alongside a small selection of earlier works, produced in the last year. The exhibition is on view in the John R. Eckel, Jr. Foundation Gallery on the Whitney’s first floor, which is free and open to the public. When I worked out where to find this gallery (since I had actually never been to it before due to it’s sort of tucked away locale), it made me question the meaning of the exhibition placement in the large context of the Whitney. If you’re giving this artist a, to use a Solange reference, seat at the table, is there such a thing as a sub-par seat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last Guggenheim exhibition I saw was &lt;em&gt;Italian Futurism&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Art&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;China after 1989: Theater of the World&lt;/em&gt; is a very different show and provides the contemporary-Sino follow-up. While Futurism celebrates technology and modernity, the contemporary moment is beyond celebrating technology–it’s now haunted by it. In both American and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/meghara/the-police-state-of-the-future-is-already-here?utm_term=.ey10op1Nz#.sv8EX1r6y&quot;&gt;Chinese surveillance/police state eras&lt;/a&gt;, civil liberties are a joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4476/26298854519_cb5ebfd016_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Censored work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the show even opened it was strewn in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/arts/design/guggenheim-dog-fighting-exhibit.html&quot;&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt;. Bowing to censorship and citing the safety of its visitors, staff and artists in the show, the Guggenheim ultimately decided to censor its own exhibition after receiving a number of violent threats. The three works pulled, which all involve animals, are “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” “Theater of the World” and “A Case Study of Transference.” According to the New York Times, these works were pieces chosen among around 150 works, mostly experimental art and many shocking and intending to challenge authority and use of animals (in video) and to call attention to the violence of humankind. (Protestors marched outside of the museum and managed to gather half a million signatures asking the museum to pull the works).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4497/38044082132_7600dcd85a_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Zhou Tiehai, “There Came a Mr. Solomon to China” 1994&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” by artist collective Sun Yuan and Peng Yu (an artist collective I included in my master’s thesis in 2014), features pit bulls on motorized treadmills trying to fight one another, but they cannot touch because they are chained. “A Case Study of Transference” depicts tattooed pigs having sex before a human audience. “Theater of the World,” the signature work of the show, was to feature hundreds of live insects and reptiles under an overhead lamp. This decision makes me angry. While I’m totally pro-animal rights (fuck factory farms, fuck puppy mills, fuck declawing your cat), Sun Yuan and Pen Yu operate in a space that’s supposed to be controversial and it was only a video of their work that was to be shown–documentation that was not meant to send a pro-animal abuse message. This whole body of work is trying to say something about human rights and how we exist in the contemporary moment and the people signing that petition clearly don’t understand the work. It’s this angry hive mentality that can be dangerous–especially when it doesn’t really understand what it’s doing with the power that it doesn’t even realize it has. As much of the criticism against the censorship stated, it’s setting a bad precedent for the art world and for first amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tT1J1sc3j3w?feature=oembed&quot; title=&quot;Chen Zhen&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x22;Precipitous Parturition&quot;&gt;Chen Zhen’s “Precipitous Parturition”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all being said, I really wanted to love this exhibition, but I walked away disappointed. I still got a lot out of it, but it felt like something crucial was missing–perhaps this was the censored works, but it felt more related to the format of the exhibition–which was very conceptional and video heavy. The show was hard to read as a whole and it left me more of an explanation. The most powerful works for me were the works dealing with the Bishan Commune, Ai Weiwei’s works related to the schoolchildren who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and Chen Chieh-jen’s video work “Factory,” depicting the plight of female workers in a clothing factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4443/38044083442_e220be088b_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Ou Ning, Bishan Commune: How to Start Your Own Utopia (Sketchbook)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bishan Commune was a social project started by Ou Ning, an artist and activist involved with a transnational rural reform movement. It tacked impending social crises, including the environmental threats in rural townships worldwide. Ou settled in Bishan, a small village in Anhui Province rich in cultural history, and in tandem with curator Zuo Jing created an independent commune (complete with its own currency and passports). With the help of fellow agrarian activists and a local farming community, the worked to advance new models of social, economic, and spiritual well-being through a schedule of social activities centered around buildings for research residencies, a library and bookstore, a learning center, a shop for local products, and communal gathering spaces. The commune existed as an alternative social entity that was relatively independent from the government’s control until 2016, when local authorities forced Ou to evacuate the premises and the Bishan Commune to close. (Information from The Guggenheim’s press release).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4493/26298854159_747b0e1e78_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Gu Dexin, Plastic Pieces—287&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept of a commune or a semi-autonomous governance within another, larger, parent municipality is endlessly fascinating. It’s also sort of crazy to think that something like the Bishan Commune existed for a whole seven years within China–where on one hand communists should be very pro-something like this, but in practice just exercise complete control over its citizens. Having just visited Freetown Christiania in Denmark this past June and just having visited Israel (although unfortunately I did not visit a kibbutz), this is always something that’s resonated with me. Am I just looking for some elusive, fictional utopia? Am I looking for a form of escapism? Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Jordan]]></title><description><![CDATA[Old City, Jerusalem My interest in the Middle East began before the Israeli Society course I took as an undergraduate–but that particular…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/israel-the-palestinian-territories-and-jordan/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/israel-the-palestinian-territories-and-jordan/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2017 01:25:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4334/37043025732_5904b6920c_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Old City, Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My interest in the Middle East began before the Israeli Society course I took as an undergraduate–but that particular course nurtured it. Growing up in a Catholic family, places like Galilee, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Jericho and Nazareth get their fair share of shoutouts during gospel readings and priestly homilies (I’m no longer practicing the faith). This land entranced with such contention over land rights that stem back to biblical times is truly a wondrous place. M. and I were recently lucky enough to get the opportunity to travel to Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan on holiday and visited a friend in Tel Aviv. Here’s how the trip went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4366/37058727822_cd33dfbbd1_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, September 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After around a 10 hour flight from Newark (both in middle seats) we arrive in Tel Aviv we rent a car and drive immediately to Tzfat in the north (about a 2 hour drive). Caveat: it’s Shabbat and our Bed &amp;#x26; Breakfast in this little sleepy, artsy, city of Jewish mysticism tells us that they cannot check us in after the start of Shabbat and that we’ll have to leave cash money in our room and email pictures of our passports and entry visas and a key will be in our room. Our hosts greet us and show us the lay of the land and lend me a skirt, shirt covering my collar bones and another shirt below the elbows. M. wears a white shirt and borrows a &lt;em&gt;kippah&lt;/em&gt; for Shabbat dinner. We venture off into the city–no cars on the road–only sounds of song in the air. We make our way to the House of Love and Prayer looking for a contact we emailed about Shabbat dinner. Men sit on a patio singing prayers, dressed in black and white, some wearing &lt;em&gt;shtreimels.&lt;/em&gt; When we ask a man sitting on a wall if this was indeed the House of Love and Prayer, he replies that it is. We tell him that we’re looking for Shabbat dinner and he asked us if we would like to join him and his wife and their friends at his house. &lt;strong&gt;“The most important part of Shabbat is not being alone.”&lt;/strong&gt; He had two friends in town (one from Jerusalem and one from Jersey) and he was sitting outside of services waiting to pick them up. It would be impossible to explain what unfolded over the next four hours, but we ate and drank and hummed along to prayers in Hebrew and received enthusiastic answers to all of our questions about the faith. We also discussed the seven nohide laws and the late Rabbi and musician Shlomo Carlebach.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Two gentiles spent Shabbat in Tzfat, meet a Rabbi originally from Manhattan and had a lovely time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4356/36400817403_2307493d7a_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Sea of Galilee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, September 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We wake up, eat our shomer Shabbat breakfast and venture the town a bit. We walk through the Artist Quarter and one shop is open so we venture in. We walk through the Jewish cemetery and through the park and old citadel. Then we pack up and get on the road and drive back to Tel Aviv, with a stop in Tiberias to take a quick dip in the Sea of Galilee. The experience was great (minus the rusty nails and dirty diapers). We arrive in Tel Aviv, are told not to take the train to Jerusalem (rookie mistake) after already buying train tickets and take the bus instead. We arrive in Jerusalem and take a quick stroll down a bustling street lined with bars (Machane Yehuda), which turns out to be frequented by 18-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4377/37024949276_46f7ca24c5_z.jpg&quot;&gt;The Western Wall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, September 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Side note: Israelis may love instant coffee? It’s available in our hotel in Jerusalem and in the B&amp;#x26;B in Tzfat.&lt;br&gt;
We covered a lot of ground this day. We started out in the Old City at The Church of the Holy Sepulchre (the alleged site where Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected). We touched the stone where Jesus was (allegedly) anointed and wrapped after his death (the stone of unction, dated 1810), we went into Christ’s tomb (a 1810 monument where a marble slab covers the rock on which Christ’s head is believed to have laid (and we touched the stone), and we visited Golgotha–the Greek Orthodox altar which we also touched, venerated as the site of the crucifixion. Next, we visited the Western Wall, where women need to cover their heads and men must wear a kippah and are separated according to gender. We tried to visit the Dome of the Rock/the Temple Mount/Harem esh-Sharif/Al-Aqsa mosque, but it was a Muslim holiday and they were only admitting Muslims. In the bible, the Temple Mount is where the Jewish temples stood. In Sunni Muslim tradition, the site is where Muhammad ascended to heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4428/37043028682_77f777de71_z.jpg&quot;&gt;The City of David&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proceeded to the City of David and explored the tunnels and water system. On the way, we walked down part of Via Dolorosa (the path where it is believed that Jesus walked on the way to his crucifixion). We also got a great view of the Mount of Olives and the Jewish cemetery and stumbled upon a Muslim cemetery. We circled back to the Armenian Quarters before heading back to the hotel and getting dinner at an amazing place called Mona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4335/36400814853_f9be4a4810_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Israeli West Bank Barrier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, September 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We woke up pretty early for a guided tour of Bethlehem in the West Bank. We first stopped in Shepherd’s grotto, the site where shepherds who were told of Jesus’s birth slept. Then we stopped at a Christian souvenir shop so we could buy religious tchotchkes and bless them. Next, we went to the Church of the Nativity, the alleged site of Jesus’s birth. The church itself has three chapels (one Catholic, one Armenian and one Greek Orthodox). The church was super crowded and chaotic and the experience was marred by congestion and sea of tourists and angry gate keepers. The last stop on the tour was a trip to the Milk Grotto–a church where it is again alleged that Mary’s milk hit the ground and turned the stones white. It is also believed that the milky white stone is good for healing and fertility. Seeing the West Bank wall was the most emotional part of the day. Israelis are not allowed to enter restricted West Bank areas and it is dangerous to do so (especially if they are Jewish Israelis). Posters on sale in Bethlehem included maps detailing land mass loss since 1948 and the Banksy work (a dove wearing a bullet-proof vest and a red cross-hair target).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the tour, we had dinner at a pasta place in the Machane Yehuda market and had a drink at a chill local bar where we listened to electro tunes spun by a dude in dreads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4421/36400818333_e700008c62_z.jpg&quot;&gt;View from Masada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, September 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another day, another tour. This time to Masada where we took a cable car to the top of the ancient fortress that’s the former site of King Herod’s palace, Roman invasion, and mass Jewish suicide. It was also about 115 degrees fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4357/37024949846_b24fe516fe_z.jpg&quot;&gt;The Dead Sea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we went to visit Ein Geti, a spa where you have access to the Dead Sea–the lowest place on earth. It’s also maybe the hottest place on earth and the sea water (really, a lake) is hotter than bath water. Then, without time to shower, and with slight heat exhaustion, we get on a bus for a 3.5 hour ride to our 3-star hotel in Eilat. We don’t have time to explore Eilat (known for scuba diving, a dolphin cove and beaches). Filled with exhaustion from the busy, hot day, we don’t even wander Eilat at night and pass out. (Catch ya next time, Eilat!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4350/37043027292_ac6ddaf5d8_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, September 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After some swift, crafty border crossing with the help of our tour company we walk across the Israeli/Jordanian border and cross from Eilat to Aqaba, Jordan. We drive north to visit Petra, the ancient rock-cut city in a deep valley where the northern Arabian tribe the Nabataeans once inhabited the lands. According to our guide, the famous Treasury site (and many of the well-recognized sites in Petra) are actually tombs carved in the rocks, because the Nabateans believed placed a higher value on the afterlife. It was amazing how well preserved the Treasury is–with such a high level of detail intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4342/36400815983_5984c2b80f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Carmel Shuk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, September 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our friend/host (I.) in Tel Aviv gave us a free, centrally located place to stay, and educated us on local food and drink (because honestly, with the exception of a couple meals, we were mostly eating airport and grab-and-go food and even sunk as low as truck stop falafel…). After our flight from Eilat Wednesday night, we took a car to City Center where we smoked a hookah and were introduced to Tubi 60 (a ginger/herb/citrus-based local liquor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. and I woke up late (I. had to work) and went to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (in short, underwhelming collection, pretty cool building) and then headed to Banana Beach. Tel Aviv IS beaches and they really have some nice public ones. It was great to just nap on the sand and swim a bit (the waves were pretty intense).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we had pita at a local place for dinner and met up with a friend of I.’s at an arak bar in Florentin. During our chat that primarily focused on politics, I learned that Gaza (run by the Hamas) only receives about 4 hours of electricity a day. Upon further research, it looks like Gaza won’t even be habitable by the year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4395/37088675841_139075d30c_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, September 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our last full day in Israel. I. took us to his usual Shabbat brunch spots–we went to a great hummus place called Hashomer and went shopping for produce and gifts. M. and I went back to the beach, while I. did some work. We met up for dinner in Jaffa at Orza, explored the hood a bit, picked up some sweets, and then walked home on the boardwalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4350/37231827035_4b49c8497f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, September 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After a quick local breakfast, we got on our 11 hour flight back to Newark. Until next time, Israel. You’re a super complicated place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Future We Can Vibe With]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/a-future-we-can-vibe-with/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/a-future-we-can-vibe-with/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 01:52:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-9.51.37-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-11-at-9.51.37-PM-1019x1024.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cleveland Museum of Art]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/cleveland-museum-of-art/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/cleveland-museum-of-art/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2017 17:19:43 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 634px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4313/36069630876_626f512ba4_z.jpg)Botticelli and studio
&lt;/div&gt;I was in Cleveland for a wedding over the fourth of July weekend (July 1–2) and went to the Cleveland Museum of Art on Sunday before flying back to New York. (Side note: American Airlines is terrible, our flight from Laguardia got cancelled and we had to drive seven hours through the night to get there). The collection covered antiquity through present and while their collection isn’t stellar (through they do have a holding of many large artists), I really enjoyed how the works are displayed, the flow of the museum, and the architecture of the building.

&lt;/div&gt;I just returned from a trip more than a year in the making with two dear friends (S and K) to London, Copenhagen, and Stockholm. The trip was a much needed reprieve from New York and the work grind.
&lt;p&gt;A funny (read: annoying) thing happened to my while I was away: my DSLR started giving me an error message and although it still captured pictures–they came out super dark. I didn’t realize it was busted before I left the States and the problem persisted throughout the trip. So some of the images I include here have lost a bit of their integrity, but gained a ’70s analog aesthetic. Thankfully most were salvageable with some Photoshop work. The others were taken on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 632px&quot;&gt;![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4227/34626096643_c931233b59_z.jpg)Grayson Perry
&lt;/div&gt;**Friday, June 9**
&lt;p&gt;Our flight got into London in the morning–leaving us a full day to wander the city. After a nap to overcome the jet lag and a snack, S hung back with her sister (who hosted us) while K and I navigated the underground/tube and made our way (quite ambitiously) to the Serpentine Galleries (where we saw amazing works by U.K. artist and Turner recipient, Grayson Perry and LA artist Arthur Jafa), Hyde Park, The National Portrait Gallery, and the Tate Modern. S’s sister hosted a barbecue for us + her in-laws (in-town from the States) and their friend. It was a lovely night of wine and grilling with a lot of discussion re: art (also discussing the new Tate viewing deck that looks straight into the living rooms of high-priced London flats) and politics and the Sound of Music and the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px&quot;&gt;![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4228/35435590885_e3b26832b0_z.jpg)Dreamland Margate
&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, June 10**
&lt;p&gt;The real impetus for our trip was Demon Dayz: the musical festival hosted by Gorillaz/Damon Albarn featuring most of the artists on their new album &lt;em&gt;Humanz.&lt;/em&gt; The festival was at Dreamland at Margate–a seaside theme park similar to Coney Island (only better maintained/not as creepy). We got on a bus and made our way to Margate from London (about an hour and 45 minute drive) where we had the best fish and chips (no exaggeration), ate way too much cotton candy, got a sunburn, waited in line for over an hour for a dinner of fried chicken sandwiches and fries, rode the wooden roller coaster, and the ferris wheel and jammed to Damon and co. into the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4201/35435590685_a0ac68c8fa_z.jpg)Tivoli
&lt;/div&gt;**Sunday, June 11**   
In the morning, we flew from London to Copenhagen. Because we simply did not consume enough sugar or amusement park fun at Margate, the first thing we did upon arrival in Copenhagen was visit Tivoli Gardens. Our hotel/hostel was located right next to the train station so we were a mere stones throw away from Tivoli. For a flat entrance fee we were able to go on an unlimited amount of rides. We also consumed way too much licorice and had burgers, hot dogs, and fries for dinner. In addition to riding all of the roller coasters, we also went on the Hans Christensen Anderson ride, and had a session of bumper cars where we were the only three in the rink.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4283/35435591755_914bddbedd_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, June 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began our day with breakfast (more of a brunch, really) at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atelierseptember.dk/&quot;&gt;Atelier September&lt;/a&gt;, then we walked to Freetown Christiania–the self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood in Copenhagen where no one owns property, everything is shared, and people sell weed on the street. While we were there it started down-pouring and a kind resident let us take refuge in the entryway to his communal house. Afterwards we visited the Copenhagen Architecture Center and ate lunch at Copenhagen Street Food, a food hall on the harbor with an amazing selection of local and international cuisines. From there we walked to the central shopping area and visited Illums Bolighus–a department store focusing on Scandinavian design. After a stop back at the hotel, we had dinner at Baest, an upscale Italian pizza spot, and ended the night at Superkilen–an adult playground/skate park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4237/34593721894_f36ec3f317_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4225/34593723594_42889e8238_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, June 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rented a car and drove to Møns Klint in Borre, Denmark. S drove since she’s the only one who can drive manual. The chalky/rocky beaches are beautiful and the sounds that result from shuffling along the rocks add to the whole sensory experience. The various hikes down to the beach are all pretty steep and require that you then hike back up (there are many, many stairs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting back to Copenhagen, we quickly fit in a stop at the Rundetaarn observatory and had dinner at Kødbyens Fiskebar in the meatpacking district, despite the fact that S doesn’t eat seafood. Afterwards, as we were passing through a parking lot on our way home we ran into a group of Swedes/Americans and somehow ended up at two gay bars (Masken Bar and Cosy Bar) with new friends in tow. (Fun fact: You can still smoke cigarettes inside bars in Denmark).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4254/35435590325_c297539af1_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about the Danes: they are all the loveliest and friendliest lot of people ever. Apparently Denmark consistently ranks #1 for the happiest people on earth. Everyone was so welcoming and accommodating and genuinely helpful and upbeat. It was a welcome change from whatever is in the air/water in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4215/35305901751_60809972b4_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, June 14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our last day in Copenhagen, S went on a boat tour (and saw the Little Mermaid statue) and K and I went to Louisiana, which may actually be one of my favorite museums in the world. I was told that the art is secondary to the architecture and the grounds–which I now agree with. You could spend an entire day wandering around the space, admiring the views, eating lunch on the terrace, gazing at the pond, etc. There was also a huge slide for added bonus points. Such an amazing place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we flew into Stockholm and checked into our super chic, modern studio in the hip Södermalm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4242/35435592605_012c338895_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, June 15&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting caught in a downpour (and after getting a bit of a late start since the exhaustion was mounting) we decided to go to the Vasa museum–a 1628 shipwreck that was salvaged 300 years later and preserved. For dinner we ate at an amazing, kitschy Thai place on Södermalm called Koh Phangan. We tried to get a little taste of nightlife at Trägarden, but I didn’t have my ID and thus did not get in (who would have known that the security could be so strict in Europe?) The security guard/bouncer was not nice about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4280/34594172104_24d290328a_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, June 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung back at the apartment while S and K went to the Swedish history museum. I met them later in the day at the Royal Palace where we explored the Royal Apartments and chapel. For dinner we met up with a friend from grad school E at Urban Deli and went back to Trägarden for a do-over. It’s a great space located under and underpass, with multiple floors and dance floors and DJs spinning all sorts of music–an overall chill crowd and great vibes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4289/35435589975_61b34948ae_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, June 17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a boat to Vaxholm, to explore a bit of the archipelago. Didn’t get too far, but we managed to explore some of the fort and take a nap on some rocks near the water. For our last meal, we ate at an Asian place called East in central Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, June 18&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up at 5:30 a.m. for our flight back to the States.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Frieze New York]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s year two of my Frieze, New York highlights.

&lt;/div&gt;At the beginning of the month, I spent a week in LA for a work trip. The last time I was in LA was 2008, and I spent part of that trip in Anaheim at Disneyland–so it was great to see the city through a completely different (art centric) lens. East Coasters and New Yorkers in particular love to hate on LA, but the trip was pretty great overall and I would definitely at least consider moving there.
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a breakdown of the trip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 551px&quot;&gt;![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4164/34511937275_ef39f82422_z.jpg)Jean-Michel Basquiat (@ The Broad)
&lt;/div&gt;**Friday, March 31**
&lt;p&gt;I arrived late on Thursday night, after some delays and maybe the most turbulent flight I’ve ever experienced. Someone in the row behind me threw up and a teenager on a school trip kept flipping his tray table up and down (until I asked him to stop). I’m seated in a row right behind a set of bathrooms and there’s the looming smell of toilet in the air. I engage in a 6-hour armrest battle with my seat neighbor. Commercial flights are just filled with life’s small pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 524px&quot;&gt;![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4160/34511935315_ee5e5ff2e5_z.jpg)The Broad, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro
&lt;/div&gt;The jet lag is real–I consistently woke up around 6:00 a.m. (EST) throughout the trip. This is what being a morning person must be like. Spent the day setting up at The Broad (for our meeting the following Monday). Then caught dinner with some colleagues at [Norah](http://norahrestaurant.com/).

&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, April 1**
&lt;p&gt;This is the first official day of our work program. There are factions of architecture tours, artist studio visits, and private collection visits. Dinner with colleagues is held at &lt;a href=&quot;http://republiquela.com/&quot;&gt;Republique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; **Sunday, April 2**
&lt;p&gt;Day II of our work program. We continue with more artist studio visits and have lunch at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamesfgoldstein.com/?page_id=881&quot;&gt;Sheats Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; Residence (designed by John Lautner). The day concludes with private collection visits followed by dinner at a Trustee’s residence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Monday, April 3**
&lt;p&gt;Our meeting is held at the Broad in the morning and we have lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.manuela-la.com/&quot;&gt;Manuela&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hauserwirthlosangeles.com/&quot;&gt;Hauser &amp;#x26; Wirth&lt;/a&gt; to view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hauserwirth.com/exhibitions/3073/jason-rhoades-installations-1994-y-2006/view/&quot;&gt;Jason Rhoades&lt;/a&gt; exhibit. Our work program concludes with an Ed Ruscha studio visit. I have dinner with some colleagues at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.standardhotels.com/la/features/alma-restaurant-hollywood&quot;&gt;ALMA at The Standard&lt;/a&gt; in West Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Tuesday, April 4**
&lt;p&gt;I make the rounds and visit the Power exhibition at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/445&quot;&gt;Sprueth Magers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lacma.org/&quot;&gt;LACMA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hammer.ucla.edu/&quot;&gt;The Hammer&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2017/jimmie-durham-at-the-center-of-the-world/&quot;&gt;Jimmie Durham&lt;/a&gt; show was excellent). I meet up with a high school friend in Marina del Rey with whom I crash with for the rest of my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4178/33669557634_4c24a56ced_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, April 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a morning walk down to the marina (with bulletproof coffee in-hand), my friend and his girlfriend take me to Abbot Kinney Blvd (apparently the place for trendy LA shopping) and Venice Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4188/33701639653_484db32a8e_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make a stop at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theunderground-museum.org/&quot;&gt;The Underground Museum&lt;/a&gt; before meeting a college friend for dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://kayndaves.com/&quot;&gt;Kayndaves&lt;/a&gt; in Culver City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4184/34511937875_114651ca33_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, April 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my last day in LA, I manage to get it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/&quot;&gt;Getty&lt;/a&gt; (Center) for some amazing views of the city. The grounds (and garden) are pretty incredible, but the collection and exhibitions are definitely a bit hard to navigate since the building is basically housed in four separate factions (north, south, east and west).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[PopRally Presents Petra Collins: In Search of Us]]></title><description><![CDATA[Photo by Alycia Kravitz Last Saturday, March 18, I produced PopRally Presents Petra Collins: In Search of Us with MoMA’s PopRally committee…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/poprally-presents-petra-collins-in-search-of-us/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/poprally-presents-petra-collins-in-search-of-us/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Mar 2017 20:49:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, March 18, I produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/2948&quot;&gt;PopRally Presents Petra Collins: In Search of Us&lt;/a&gt; with MoMA’s PopRally committee. A little bit of background from PopRally’s website: PopRally is a series of events at MoMA and MoMA PS1 that serve as a gateway for young and diverse audiences to engage with the Museum. Led by a cross-departmental committee of Museum staff, PopRally produces dynamic programs including artist collaborations, performances, film screenings, and digital content that encourage new and experimental ways of engaging with modern and contemporary art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PopRally x Petra project that was more than a year in the making, and in the end it came together seamlessly–thanks to the helping hands of a pretty large team. The event incorporated the works of three digital artists–Madelyne Beckles (@bellhoox, who also co-curated In Search of Us with Petra), Grace Miceli (@artbabygirl) and Aleia Murawski (@aleia), which were hosted on Instagram before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2866/32823990514_c8bfe99ae9_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Photo by Alycia Kravitz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also from PopRally’s website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PopRally presents Petra Collins: In Search of Us, an evening of performance, music, and digital art conceived and developed by Collins with artist and close collaborator Madelyne Beckles. The event comprises a live, three-hour tableau in the Agnes Gund Garden Lobby, a “digital salon” hosted on Instagram, a live musical performance by Junglepussy, and a set by DJ Madeline Poole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from Lorraine O’Grady’s seminal 1992 essay “Olympia’s Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity,” Collins and Beckles will stage a live tableau in celebration of the female form. The performers will confront traditional representations of the female body throughout the art-historical canon, which tended to exclude bodies of work by such historical “others” as women, gender nonconforming individuals, and persons of color. Addressing this history through the lens of the contemporary woman—characterized by autonomy, sexuality, intersectionality, and agency—Collins presents an homage to the odalisque that highlights how women’s bodies have traditionally been both venerated and degraded. In O’Grady’s words, “She is jezebel and mammy, prostitute and female eunuch, the two in one.” Expanding upon the live performance, Collins also invited Beckles, Grace Miceli, and Aleia Murawski to create short videos as part of a “digital salon” on Instagram—in a nod to the 19th-century Salon des Independants—using the platform to re-examine the role of the canon in a contemporary context.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In advance of the event, I also interviewed Petra for PopRally’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://nyc.moma.org/petra-collins-b5b37ee717a2#.xrjm0ipr1&quot;&gt;Creative New York&lt;/a&gt; blog (conversations about art and life in New York City).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Known for her sensual, metallic aesthetic–Marilyn Minter’s paintings, photographs (and videos) explore beauty and the feminine body in American culture. She questions the fashion/cosmetic industries’ collective commercialization of sex and the body. *Marilyn Minter: Pretty/Dirty* (on view at the Brooklyn Museum through April 2, 2017) is the artist’s first retrospective.

&lt;p&gt;Estimates hover around 400,000 participants for the NYC faction of the Women’s March on DC, held last Saturday, January 21 in response to the Trump presidency’s implied message to women and targeted groups of people (i.e. the LGBTQ community, religious minorities, immigrants, etc.) A small group of friends met in Hell’s Kitchen to make signs and head to the march—which was entirely peaceful, orderly and absent of overbearing police presence. It was a small victory in the resistance movement and many more protests will be on the horizon during this administration—there’s one today in Battery Park to rally against the Muslim Ban Executive Order signed on Friday and there were several yesterday at airports around the country (JFK, SFO, LAX, ORD and Dulles) to protest the same—as many were being detained at airports after the order was signed.&lt;/p&gt;

It helps us gather our thoughts and compound dissimilar units of measurement to gauge how we spent our time or figure out what sticks after another calendar year. Even though no one reads this (except perhaps my mother, and I’m sure even she is not diligent about it), here is the fourth iteration of ‘Everything I have Read in 20XX.’ Cheers to odd years holding more promise than the even ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/447/31452450600_646ab2766f.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. 11/23/63 Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the idea of this novel because I have never read Stephen King and it’s sort of a bucket list item. There’s also a strong appeal of the conspiracy/aura/lure of everything related to the Kennedy assassination. The book uses a mix of fictional and historical characters to tell the story of protagonist, Jake Epping, an English teacher from Maine who discovers a portal and travels back in time in order to attempt to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from shooting JFK. While the time travel device is often seen as trite, King uses it well. Don’t bother touching the James Franco show based on the book–it’s garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/427/31677957572_0996d5af15.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The Chinese in America, Iris Chang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up resenting my (half) Chinese heritage and constantly being annoyed at my father for trying to force me to watch PBS Documentaries about early Chinese immigrants and the lives they carved out for themselves in the United States. It took a while to realize that my self-imposed shame was a product of my environment. The book is a chronology of the uphill battles Chinese immigrants and their descendants fought and continue to fight since first coming to America–including the racist and exclusionary laws and the occupation of a racial space that falls in between black and white. It’s an eye-opening read that sheds light on racial and ethnic issues that continue to be prevalent in contemporary America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c7.staticflickr.com/1/453/31787740046_20da2ef259.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. My Brilliant Friend, Elena Ferrante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended by a coworker, this is the first book in the four-volume Neapolitan Novels Series. The author maintains anonymity and Ferrante is the pseudonym she employs. Earlier this fall, there was speculation over her true identity amid an Italian journalist’s speculation that Ferrante was actually a Rome-based translator named Anita Raja. All of the books in the series are quick reads and play on themes of female friendship, family, love, loss, hardship and ‘coming of age.’ The main characters Lena and Lila grow up in a poor neighborhood in Naples (‘the neighborhood’) and their divergent paths pull them apart, while their roots solidify an eternal bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/292/31677958592_43f2a63e28.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Story of a New Name, Elena Ferrante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this may have been my favorite in the series, perhaps because of the years it covers in Lena’s and Lila’s lives. Things remain hopeful for the characters, even though they are going through hardship and their relationship matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5602/31452450260_5e7e340ece.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, Elena Ferrante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps my least favorite in the series because of the content and while things were always a bit dark throughout, they seemed to take a serious turn here. It’s hard to express specifics without giving away too much of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5600/31452450540_20da2ef259.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently become interested in UX Design and started a shortlist of design books related to the discipline that could be helpful and informative. It’s a great look into products and why some are successful and solve problems, while others are just infuriating and frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c4.staticflickr.com/6/5596/31015660523_1bbab09c82.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. The Story of the Lost Child, Elena Ferrante&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the last book in the series more than the third and I enjoyed the whole series overall tremendously–even though the characters’ personalities and actions are infuriating at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/778/31452450520_dcfb069d55.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The Devil, Leo Tolstoy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a title as a giveaway, sure it’s expected that this will be dark. The art of the novella is definitely under-appreciated. The tale is about a married man who cannot control his lust for a woman from a different class–and naturally, the ensuing consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/657/31015660063_9c50248d9e.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Moby Dick, Herman Melville&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this book is one of those classics that one puts off reading indefinitely because the task seems too daunting. Read it in the summer, dream of a trip to modern-day Nantucket and revel in the Cetology and the pre-Darwinian belief systems. The character development is a lot stronger in the first 1/3 or so of the book and it sort of drops off/gets lost after that. Still enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c6.staticflickr.com/1/283/31015660373_dd364c798d.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Gilead, Marilyne Robinson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is one of Obama’s favorite novels. It’s religious and it’s set in small town Gilead, Iowa in 1956. The narrator, 76-year-old pastor named John Ames, who believes he is dying, is writing what is essential his memoirs to his 7-year-old son. The letter recounts a lifetime of memories, offers moral advice, and gives all of the tidbits one would expect to receive from a dying man quick to get everything on paper. Obama cited this book (along with the works of Shakespeare, the Bible and Moby Dick) as among his favorite works that help him better understand the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c2.staticflickr.com/1/508/31015660193_e636033300.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Hooked, Nir Eyal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same UX vein as The Design of Everyday Things, Hooked outlines why some products ‘capture our attention, while others flop.’ The hook model is a four-step process that companies use to introduce customer habits. I think that it is hard for me to process this type of information in this format and I need to be able to digest it in a different, perhaps more interactive manner. I found it hard to retain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c4.staticflickr.com/1/527/31015660483_f0292b78f0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. The Complete Short Stories, Flannery O’Connor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not very well-read in fiction by women authors and I wanted to remedy this. Cue this series of short stories–including one of O’Connor’s most well-known, A Good Man is Hard to Find. O’Connor was a southern writer focusing on regional settings and grotesque characters. Her Roman Catholic background was also drawn upon in her writing, as are mortality and ethics. Dark is an understatement when describing her works. It’s also a bit weird digesting the racial terminology of the day. While tough to read at times (due to the graphic nature and general attitudes of the characters), these stories are successful at conveying the sentiment of the locale and the time. They’re like a neatly packaged bundle of racism told by an excellent narrator with a knack for getting to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/1/384/30984543284_478e6dee1a.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. M Train, Patty Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to Smith’s Just Kids follow-up. Her previous work left a huge impression on many and really romanticized the 1970s New York City landscape. Her love affair with Robert Mapplethorpe and their trials and tribulations really provided the crux of the story. But M Train did not live up to my expectations. It reads more like poetry (or at least attempts to take that form). There is no narrative and the book simply outlines Smith’s day-to-day. It’s peppered with encounters with famous friends (i.e. ‘Klaus’), post-Hurricane Sandy strife and a pain-staking account of every cup of coffee consumed within the last 5 or so years. She also recounts many of her trips abroad, but fails to make them compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c7.staticflickr.com/1/408/31452450470_795a6f3109.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. UTZ, Bruce Chatwin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recommendation from a co-worker (from my defacto boss, actually). Kaspar Utz is a collector of Meissen porcelain in Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. He manages to find his way outside of the eastern bloc to obtain new pieces. He considers becoming a defector, but cannot bear to leave his collection behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c3.staticflickr.com/1/491/31677957882_317b82467c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P., Adelle Waldman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of those books that’s sort of considered trendy and I fell into its trap. It’s the ‘coming-of-age’ story of Nate–a Harvard man in his early 20s in New York City (let’s get more cliche). Despite his Ivy League background, he’s hardly complex. He’s sort of a self-interested serial monogamist who’s just indecisive and whiny. Nate’s not a likable character and he occupies the annoying space of every other entitled white male before him. His search for ‘love and happiness’ has no real conflict or resolution. The characters all really lack depth–there’s also no story arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/666/31015659983_81802fcfd9.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. The Sellout, Paul Beatty&lt;/strong&gt; Winner of the Man Booker prize, it’s difficult and poignant and it gives a shockingly accurate portrayal of the racial landscape of contemporary America. The narrator (referred to by his last name, ‘Me’), tries to reintroduce slavery and segregation in his Los Angeles neighborhood, which eventually leads to a Supreme Court case. The story manages to be simultaneously funny and troubling. I was reading this book during the election. On the day of the election results, its contents, while meant to be a satire, became entirely too real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c8.staticflickr.com/1/611/31708871671_1f58c5092c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne &amp;#x26; John Tiffany&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main complaints (on Amazon and virtually everywhere): it feels like this isn’t J.K. Rowling’s work–because it isn’t (entirely). But, I had to–because I knew it was out there and while I did not have high hopes, I’m glad I did it. Other complaints include: time travel tropes used are tiresome, the dialogue feels forced, and the characters feel stretched. Please stop. No more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/649/31677957952_4ffb318291.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;18. Hillbilly Elegy, J.D. Vance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot rave enough about this memoir–it’s such a compelling story. The author’s family has roots in Kentucky and he grows up in Ohio–he’s essentially raised by his grandparents and comes from pretty extreme poverty (for American standards). The subject matter and rust-belt locale are timely in a post-election world and the story begins to answer the questions raised by the election results. The story deals with addiction, politics, industrialism, and family. Vance struggles through early life and then manages to overcome every statistic stacked against him to end up at Yale Law. His writing is clear, concise and carries so much emotional weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kerry James Marshall: Mastery]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marshall was born in pre-Civil Rights Act Birmingham, Alabama.

&lt;/div&gt;On view through January 29, 2017, Kerry James Marshall: Mastery at The Met Breuer is the largest retrospective to date of African-American artist KJM. Marshall’s works attempt to “counter stereotypical representations of black people in society and reassert the place of the black figure within the canon of Western painting.”
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 829px&quot;&gt;![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5349/30330684553_a0458a10fb_b.jpg)Still Life With Wedding Portrait, 2015
&lt;/div&gt;This exhibition runs concurrently with Kerry James Marshall Selects, curated by the artist (drawing works from The Met’s collection) and providing historical context for Marshall’s practice. Note The Met’s encyclopedia collection actually spans over 5,000 years. Rooting/positioning himself within these art historical parameters (bookends) solidified Marshall as a true ‘master’ of his craft.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 752px&quot;&gt;![](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5812/30330683783_6996a9f9f7_b.jpg)SOB, SOB 2003
&lt;/div&gt;From the exhibition’s curator, Ian Alteveer: “Marshall’s work illustrates the American experience as unimaginable without black history and culture. Through the tropes of traditional painting—portraiture, landscape, and other narrative modes—he builds a conversation around visibility and invisibility. The result is a stunning body of work that is both intimate and monumental.”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5599/30994082352_2040514879_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall was born in pre-Civil Rights Act Birmingham, Alabama. His figures address ‘assertions of blackness’ in a medium where Africans and African Americans have been largely invisible. His style draws from comic books and muralist tradition, while his forms take the shape of the tableau, landscape and genre paintings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 1610px&quot;&gt;![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5780/30330682793_fa7d495304_h.jpg)Campfire Girls, 1995
&lt;/div&gt;His works are poignant and compelling–in contemporary America they suddenly feel even more relevant.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Morocco]]></title><description><![CDATA[The most helpful phrases were: Hello = as-salām ‘alaykum (or just salām) Thank you = shukran God willing (or if God wills) = Inshallah (This…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/morocco/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/morocco/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 15:29:18 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5641/29808303263_2f33b3b59a_c.jpg)Journey to Marrakech

&lt;/div&gt;After a bit of deliberation re: where to venture to next, Michael and I decided on Morocco–land of camels, dates, lamb tangine, souqs, spices, desert sand dunes &amp;amp; more. (Note: It is common to see multiple spellings of many of the Moroccan cities, but I made the unilateral decision to adopt the French spellings.) We were taught about Berber culture and history (Berbers are the native North African inhabitants who lived in the region prior to Arabs invading the region in the 6th century, resulting in the spread of Islam), became well-versed in haggling in the souqs (rule of thumb = never pay more than 50% of the first offer price), and even picked up a little bit of Arabic.
&lt;p&gt;The most helpful phrases were:&lt;br&gt;
Hello = &lt;em&gt;as-salām ‘alaykum&lt;/em&gt; (or just &lt;em&gt;salām&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
Thank you = &lt;em&gt;shukran&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God willing (or if God wills) = &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshallah&quot;&gt;Inshallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (This is used quite frequently)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the Moroccans we met spoke 5+ languages (Arabic, Berber, French, English, often German and sometimes Italian as well). Most signs were written in Arabic, Berber and French. In the center of town in Marrakech, there was a host of Syrian refugees with signs in Arabic and French spelling out “I am Syrian, I need your help.” The call to prayer could be heard five times per day. I dressed conservatively and wore long pants + always covered my shoulders. Similar to the experience in Turkey, the majority of the time, only men could be seen congregating at cafes–the woman’s place is supposed to be in the home–with the family–with the house work. Women are also not seen smoking (&lt;em&gt;because only prostitutes smoke&lt;/em&gt;). We were told that there are very few mosques that you can enter in the country as a non-Muslim (the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca being one of the exceptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the trip played out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Thursday, October 6 / Friday, October 7**
&lt;p&gt;We flew Royal Air Maroc (not a terrible airline) from JFK to Casablanca (CMN) Mohammed V Airport–leaving in the evening and arriving the following morning. Major plus of our flight: it was half empty and we had a row entirely to ourselves (literally my dream). Dissuaded from spending any time in Casablanca, we immediately got on a train (and then transferred to another train) and made our way to Fes from the Casablanca airport. The trip took roughly six hours, but it was pretty straightforward and the trains were pretty decent. We passed a lot of small mud houses with tin roofs held down by rocks along the way–reminiscent of Brazilian favelas. They even came around periodically with a snack cart. We took a cab (overpriced) from the train station in Fes to our riad–&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.riad-anata.com/&quot;&gt;Riad Anata&lt;/a&gt;. We were greeted with mint tea (note: this is a must in Morocco–it usually comes loaded with sugar and it’s delicious) and butter cookies on the rooftop of the Riad–complete with a sweeping view of the town. We had a home-cooked meal at the Riad for dinner (lentils and lamp tangine with couscous and white wine) and ended the night chatting with a couple from Munich (the wife was Brazilian and the husband, German) also staying at our Riad. Too tired and jet-lagged to brave the medina, we saved our energy for the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, October 8**
&lt;p&gt;I am not usually one for guides or tours or guided tours. I like exploring and getting lost on my own. I like structure, but I don’t like someone holding my hand and diluting my experience of a city. Despite this fact, at the urging of several people who have visited Fes and navigated and got lost in the medina, we hired a guide for the day. While I was not completely happy with our guide (he worked in tandem with a driver, who did not speak English) for a host of reasons (mainly, all of the ‘artisan shops’ he took us to were shams/schemes to jack up prices for tourists), we covered a lot more ground that we would have without him and it enabled us to make the most of the little time that we had in Fes. We visited the Jewish Quarter and went into a synagogue (but missed the Jewish cemetery because it was closed for Shabbat); saw various artisan shops (pottery, weaving, rugs and the tannery–the tanner being the highlight); had a ‘nus nus’ (or half-half–half espresso and half milk; note that Moroccans do enjoy their coffee as much as they enjoy their mint tea); and we ended with a local lunch with our guide in the souqs in a very small meat shop–where we had lamb sandwiches and mint tea. In the evening, we heard the sounds of drums and horns and followed it into the streets. There we found a Moroccan wedding passing in front of our Riad, which we proceeded to follow for a solid 30 minutes. The procession picked up some local children playing in the street–who played along on their own toy drums. The procession included three large conical receptacles holding gifts covered in glass that men in the wedding party held atop their heads as they processed through the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Sunday, October 9**
&lt;p&gt;We had a breakfast on the rooftop of the Riad before heading off to our three day, two night tour through the Sahara desert and into Marrakech via 4×4 and local (Berber) guide. We drove through the Middle Atlas Mountains and through Ifane (known as the Switzerland of Morocco). We stopped in Azrou to feed Barbary Apres and through Erfoud. We stopped to buy apples and stopped in Erfoud to visit our guide’s family (his mother, step-father and siblings lived here) and had tea with them. We ended up in the Erg Chebbi Desert and started our camel trek to the bivouac camp in the middle of the sand dunes. We climbed the dunes to watch the sunset and had dinner with our camp. There was also a drum party, but the guides were definitely not feeling it. After dinner, we climbed the dunes again to look at the stars–which was hard to do because the moon was so bright, but they were still pretty visible. We met (another) German couple from Hamburg who were a part of our camel caravan. We chatted with them and their guide, Yussef, about language and politics over chicken tangine at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8677/29809398114_92892b5454_c.jpg)Rugs for sale at the Todra Gorges
&lt;/div&gt;**Monday, October 10**
&lt;p&gt;We woke up at 6:30 a.m. to watch the sunrise just after 7:00. There was more to see, since the sunset was covered by clouds the night before. After tea, we got back on our camels and headed back to the kasbah hotel to shower and have breakfast before continuing on to Rissani. We stopped along the way to visit a nomadic Berber family (also had tea with them). The nomadic tribes are goat and sheep herders and can be seen throughout the desert land attending to their flocks. The family had goat meat hanging in the ‘courtyard’ of their home and we watched a woman making bread in a small adobe oven. We then drove through the Anti Atlas and the Kasbahs to Todra Gorges where we had lunch near the river Tinghir. We continued on to Dades valley where we stayed overnight in the Xaluca Dades hotel–complete with an amazing view of the town. They also had a tennis court and we played a few games before watching the sunset and having dinner at the hotel’s buffet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8652/30403834916_1d4ba13f86_c.jpg)View from the Xaluca Dades Hotel
&lt;/div&gt;**Tuesday, October 11**
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast at the Xaluca Dades, we were back on the road and drove through a town called Ouarzazate (a noted movie town) and visited Taourirt Kasbah. Once we finally got to Marrakech, our guide dropped us off at the Jardin Majorelle (formerly owned by YSL) and we spent some time enjoying the house and garden. It was odd saying goodbye to our guide, who had essentially spend the previous 72 hours with us, sharing stories about his family (former nomads), Berber culture (it seems that Berbers and Arabs are still rivals in some regards), Morocco (how homosexuality is illegal, how police are corrupt, how the country is backwards), about politics (Moroccans like Hillary since she is a friend of Morocco–also Trump is anti-Muslim), about religion, about relationships, about humanity (key message–be nice to thy fellow man regardless of color, creed, orientation, etc., etc.) But after issuing us the advice to ‘not spend more than 50 dirhams on henna in the square,’ we parted ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite a shock to the system being submerged into Marrakech after having been guided through so much of the countryside. Marrakech is a completely different beast. We stayed at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachavana.net/&quot;&gt;Riad Pachavana&lt;/a&gt;, which was lovely–we were, again, greeted with mint tea and cookies. In the evening, we ventured to Jemaa-El-Fna–one of the top sights in Morocco. It happens to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has been in existence since the eleventh century. In the mornings, vendors sell food and juice, very, very aggressive women solicit their henna hand-painting services, snake charmers lure their serpents (and summon your money), men with monkeys in diapers on chains try to get you to place the animals on your shoulders for a picture, story-tellers gather to share their tales and tarot readers set up shop–among many other things. At night, there are more music and drum circles and food vendors. There are also more peddlers selling scarves, soaps, intense, argon oil and more. We settled on a pizza place to dinner, because we wanted a break from Moroccan food. The restaurant was in the square and had a terrace–where we shared a meal with other tourists and some kitties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, a very cute cat came to knock (paw?) at our door and we let her inside our room (we named her Riad Kitty). We gave her some water and she took a nap by the door–then as quickly as she came in, she disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8650/30142954690_703c3fa953_c.jpg)Jardin Majorelle
&lt;/div&gt;**Wednesday, October 12**
&lt;p&gt;A very successful shopping day–we ventured into the souqs of Marrakech and didn’t get lost. We bought all sorts of treasures–not without dancing around the final dirham amount for the goods first. We also visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://tiskiwin.businesscatalyst.com/&quot;&gt;Musée Tiskiwin&lt;/a&gt;, which houses some Berber items (but was pretty disorganized and very difficult to match items with descriptions) and went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maisondelaphotographie.ma/&quot;&gt;Maison de la Photographie de Marrakech&lt;/a&gt;, which houses an incredible selection of photographs documenting life in Morocco from 1870 to 1960. The amazing realization after viewing the collection is that the souqs of today are virtually indistinguishable from those in the photos. For dinner we at an amazing restaurant, Nomad, probably our favorite the whole trip. They have an incredible terrace and offer “Modern Moroccan” food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night, Riad Kitty came back to our door to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, October 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was raining in the morning, but we climbed to the top of the Riad rooftop for the view. We spotted Riad Kitty walking across the rooftops and as soon as we caught her eye, she started sprinting toward me. She then followed us down into the courtyard for breakfast and we said our goodbyes as we departed for Essaouira via SUPR@TOURS tour bus. The bus ride is about two and a half hours, but there’s a pit stop at the Atlas Cafe to use the restroom and grab a snack. Our room at the Riad Mimouna in Essaouira was a suite with an ocean view. We ventured to the port, where fishermen are selling their daily catches for you to buy and grill (at a spot nearby). We had lunch at a seafood stall and feasted on fresh shrimp, red snapper, sardines, and mantis shrimp. We had dinner at an Italian place called Baladin–pasta, pesto and penne diavolo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c8.staticflickr.com/6/5568/29808301943_99915022bd_c.jpg)Essaouira
&lt;/div&gt;**Friday, October 14**
&lt;p&gt;We had a large lunch at Umia, an Italian restaurant in Essaouira with mid-century modern decor. We climbed to the top of the fort to check out the views and then walked along the beach for a bit and waded in the water. We also walked into the outskirts of town (read, local, not tourist-area) outside of the medina. At night, we ate at a pizza place with a funky/hippy aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 810px&quot;&gt;![](https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8648/30142953460_a452c63f2f_c.jpg)Essaouira
&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, October 15**
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast at our Riad at the restaurant on the roof before heading back to Marrakech for our final day of the trip. The 10:45 a.m. bus ended up being full, so we had to wait until 3:00 p.m. for the next bus, which, at first, was sort of a bummer, but ended up totally working out because we killed time at the Hammam and got a full scrub down, mud bath and massage. At night, we ventured back to Nomad for our last meal in Morocco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, October 16&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final breakfast at our Riad before our flight back home to JFK from Marrakech with a transfer in Casablanca. We watched Casablanca on the flight home–even through we didn’t [really] visit there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take Me (I'm Yours) at The Jewish Museum]]></title><description><![CDATA[Take Me (I’m Yours) at The Jewish Museum (through February 5, 2017) encourages viewers to engage with the art through touch, taste and even…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/take-me-im-yours-at-the-jewish-museum/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/take-me-im-yours-at-the-jewish-museum/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 01:44:45 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5300/29784047050_3e1c594cca_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Me (I’m Yours) at The Jewish Museum (through February 5, 2017) encourages viewers to engage with the art through touch, taste and even allows them to take works of art by the 42 artists in the exhibition home. Take Me vis-à-vis traditional forms of art exhibitions is unconventional, but plays on the ideas of relational aesthetics. The idea is that viewers (who are given a plastic bag and an exhibition guide via a metallic paper towel dispenser) are supposed to ‘curate’ their own personal collections. Add in something about consumerism and value and traditional art viewership and voilà!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8799/29964810582_bc6fcca9d2_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeled after an iconic 1995 Serpentine Gallery exhibition of the same name in London conceived by Hans Ulrich Obrist and Christian Boltanski, this iteration is more expansive (the original only included twelve artists). The themes drawn from in the exhibition include possession and the anarchist idea that ‘ownership is theft.’ So you’re thinking about the museum as an archive (that’s never been done before). You’re giving away free shit (who doesn’t love free shit?!). You’re facilitating sharing and dialogue. Hourra!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;An impromptu decision to attend the Drake/Future Summer Sixteen tour inspired a long weekend trip to Nashville, Tennessee. New Orleans is to jazz (and New York is to hip hop/Memphis is to blues) as Nashville is to country. I haven’t spent much time in the South and I am not a huge country fan, but the majority of my travel tends to be international and I am always open to exploring more of the US. Here’s how it all played out:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, August 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being delayed for 4 hours at Laguardia (following weather cancellations and Delta’s major computer meltdown that caused the airline to ground thousands of flights world-wide earlier in the week), we finally arrived in Nashville. Our hotel was in the heart of Music Row, so we ventured to The ROW, Kitchen &amp;#x26; Pub for some BBQ and country tunes. The indoor/outdoor seating focused on a stage where one young lady from Massachusetts sang country tunes. Despite only living in Nashville for one year, her southern drawl was very pronounced. After dinner, we headed to Broadway (the Bourbon/6th Street of Nashville) to view the spectacle that is downtown Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8452/29062694332_523db9a574_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, August 13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our one day to be true tourists in the Music City. First, we visited Centennial Park, which is home to the only full-scale replica of the Parthenon. Built to commemorate Tennessee’s Centennial in 1897 and meant only for a temporary exhibition, Nashville residents pushed to make the structure a permanent part of the city’s landscape. (It was originally built with wood, brick and plaster, but it was later rebuilt with concrete). The site also houses an art museum and the interior features a reproduction of the Athena Parthenos statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the park &amp;#x26; the Parthenon, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.johnnycashmuseum.com/&quot;&gt;Johnny Cash Museum&lt;/a&gt;, where the same two Johnny Cash songs looped while we walked through a timeline of Cash’s life and musical accomplishments and a trove of costumes and record covers. The museum was small a bit gimmicky, but definitely informative and fun to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;A quick (read: 45 minute) walk lead us into East Nashville (after crossing the pretty rad John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge and passing the Nissan Stadium + a host of tailgaters where the Tennessee Titans had a game that evening). We caught the tail end of the Tomato Festival (an annual “costume friendly” art festival) held in the Five Points area of East Nashville. When it started to downpour, we quickly sought refuge inside the nearest bar, which happened to be the Red Door Saloon. It was a quirky, Chicago dive bar (complete with tons of Pabst and Cubs paraphernalia and many, many skulls/skeletons) that perfeclty suited our needs. (Note: Smoking is still allowed inside Tennessee bars). After a few drinks, we continued our journey to [Pepperfire](http://www.pepperfirehotchicken.com/) for some hot chicken. Heat options include: Southernfied (no heat), Light Mild (a little heat), Mild (noticeable heat), Medium (significant heat), Hot (painful for most), X Hot!\* and XX Hot!\* (\*these will jump on you and won’t let go!). I went for Medium, which was still really, really intense and Michael opted for XX Hot (and he barely survived). Opting for a ‘low key’ night out, we headed to Rebar, a stone’s throw from our hotel, where we played a few rounds of Skee ball (my favorite) and watched the Olympics on their outdoor dance floor, while packs of people strategically pranced around us.

&lt;/div&gt;**Sunday, August 14**
&lt;p&gt;After a successful quest to obtain a print version of the New York Times (to read the amazing feature, &lt;em&gt;Fractured Lands: How the Arab World Came Apart&lt;/em&gt;), we visited the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cheekwood.org/&quot;&gt;Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. The Cheek family made their forture with the Maxwell House coffee brand. The Cheeks sold Maxwell House’s parent company, Cheek-Neal Coffee in 1928 to Postum (now General Foods). The Cheeks used the proceeds to purchase 100 acres of land and hired the New York residential and landscape architect, Bryant Fleming, to complete the construction of the limestone mansion and gardens. Cheekwood was completed in 1932. In the 1950s the site was offered as a site for a botanical garden and art museum. It opened to the public in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 499px&quot;&gt;![](https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8099/28549520683_75f58bd027_z.jpg)Future
&lt;/div&gt;In the evening: it’s the Drake/Future Summer Sixteen show at the Bridgestone Arena. A girl two rows in front of us wears her sunglasses and Snapshats videos of herself all night. Drake mentions that tomorrow is his day off and that he’s looking to hang out with a lucky lady tonight–even if it’s just to chill and get drinks. He says Nashville is like home since his pops is from Memphis. He also gives a nod to Shania Twain who was in the audience. Doors are at 6:30 and the show ends around 11:30.
&lt;p&gt;Notes: Nashville, you were fun, but a little bit too racist for me. Complete lack of ‘diversity’ and too many Trump vibes outside of East Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panorama Music Festival]]></title><description><![CDATA[Run the Jewels Panorama 2016: July 22, 23 & 24 @ Randall’s Island Park The above picture is from Day 3 of the Panorama Music Festival, taken…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/panorama-music-festival/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/panorama-music-festival/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2016 22:42:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panorama 2016: July 22, 23 &amp;#x26; 24 @ Randall’s Island Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above picture is from Day 3 of the Panorama Music Festival, taken during the Run the Jewels set. In a fraught time of immense political and racial turmoil, there’s nothing like a music festival to usher a bit of unity and a glimmer of hope. Former adamant Bernie supporter, Killer Mike and El-P offered the following during their set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Raise your hand if you know we’re gonna take this fuckin world back.” –El-P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take care of your fellow motherfucking citizens.” –Killer Mike&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;In previous trips to Europe, I never made it to Germany or Austria. I think that I just kept going back to Italy and exploring different regions there and while I’ve covered a good portion of Western Europe–Germany just never happened. Which is why my most recent trip was such a long time coming–whenever you bring up Berlin in a conversation (especially to anyone remotely involved in or interested in the art world) your inquiries are met with a praise chorus of enthusiasm.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1, Tuesday: Munich&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Anna and I flew into Berlin and then immediately boarded a plane to Munich. The city itself is pretty self-contained and we stayed in Euro Youth Hostel, which was conveniently located next to the Hauptbahnhof Central Station. We walked to city square (Marienplatz/Glockenspiel) and saw Frauenkirche and Neues Rathaus and walked to the Isar River. Note: on this day, three separate groups of men mocked us for being Asian (threw up peace signs, tried to take pictures of us and yelled “Ching Chong Chang” while we were crossing the street). Aside from the casual racism (because who cares about being PC when it comes to Asians?) Munich was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7347/27524642003_6687fb9dce_z.jpg)Neuschwanstein Castle
&lt;/div&gt;**Day 2, Wednesday: Munich (Day trip to Füssen/Neuschwanstein Castle)**
&lt;p&gt;Munich is a great transportation hub/launching pad for day trips. We took the train to Füssen to the “must-see tourist trap,” the Neuschwanstein (Disney) castle–the home of Ludwig II–former King of Bavaria, who was never married, had no heirs, was briefly engaged to his cousin at one point, and was gay (although the audio tour failed to mention this last bit). Major supporter of the arts and Richard Wagner’s opera works–he modeled his throne room after the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The actual tour was only 30 minutes and the audio guide was lacking–leaving you wanting to know more about the life (and mysterious death at age 40) of Ludwig II. The Bavarian Alps were breath-taking and straight out of the Sound of Music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we ended up at an indoor/outdoor beer pub, where we watched part of the Italy/Ireland EuroCup match (Ireland won, 1-0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7484/27524640753_207ae09fd3_z.jpg)Salzburg
&lt;/div&gt;**Day 3, Thursday: Munich, (Day trip to Salzburg), Berlin**
&lt;p&gt;Instead of covering more of Munich (a day or two is really all one needs there), we decided to take an impromptu trip to Salzburg–birthplace of Mozart. It was a 90 minute train ride from Munich and our time there was pretty limited, but we managed to squeeze in a visit to Schloss Mirabell and Festung Hohensalzburg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rushed back to Munich to get to the airport for our flight to Berlin. Stayed at the Circus Hostel (at the recommendation of a friend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4, Friday: Berlin (Sachsenhausen)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took the train to Oranienburg (about 40 minutes outside of Berlin) to the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp/Soviet Camp Memorial. It was a 95 degree day and the audio/walking tour took over four and a half hours to complete. Most of the original structures had been taken down, but a lot of the buildings were marked. Two of the barracks were part of the memorial site and the interiors–including bunks–had been reconstructed according to the accounts of former prisoners. The audio guide also featured chilling first-hand accounts from former prisoners. Some 200,000 passed through Sachsenhausen between 1936 and 1945–when the camp was liberated by the Red Army and Polish troops. With the advance of the Red Army, Sachsenhausen was evacuated on April 20-21, 1945 when 33,000 inmates were forced to march east on a ‘death march.’ Some 3,000 remaining inmates were liberated on April 22, 1945. The visit was obviously solemn, but nonetheless important to acknowledge the history of that region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night we ate dinner at a wine fair in Potsdamer Platz and tried to go to Berghain (unsuccessfully). Ended up eating pizza at the hostel instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7364/27524507614_36e4e32ea1_z.jpg)Brandenburg Gate
&lt;/div&gt;**Day 5, Saturday: Berlin**
&lt;p&gt;Had to relocate to East Berlin Hostel. Anna went to visit her high school friend, Esther, who lives in Berlin (but is relocating back to the States this summer). During her visit, I went to the Berlin Biennale at The Academy of the Arts and the KW Center for Contemporary Art. Lots of video art curated by the artist collective DIS, but there was one performance piece that I particularly enjoyed–a work by Alexandra Pinici tiled ‘Signals,’ where a group of performers dressed in black spandex suits affixed with small dimly lit bulbs acted out a series of very short, sometimes comical or musical acts in a small, dark box of a room. The audience is left to navigate their bodies in an awkward space and learn how to maneuver based on their own individual level of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled into a wonderful little comic book shop called Berliner Comicbibliothek and then met up with Anna again to go shopping for a bit in Hackeschermarkt where we also grabbed bubble tea at ComeBuy. We ate dinner at a Japanese place called Hashi. At night, we went to Tresor–a pretty subpar club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 649px&quot;&gt;![](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7110/27524642793_9abc4cf56f_z.jpg)Botticelli at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin
&lt;/div&gt;**Day 6, Sunday: Berlin**
&lt;p&gt;We went to the Gemäldegalerie, which has a wonderful selection of Old Masters Paintings. There were even some wonderful Botticellis. Afterwards, we went to the flea market at Mauerpark, which was a spectacular show of music, food, vendors, crafts, and people watching. At night we went to Club der Visionaere, which was pretty perfect and lively for a Sunday (and since the previous two nights somewhat let us down).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**Day 7, Monday: Berlin**
&lt;p&gt;On our last full day in Berlin, we went to the Neues Museum (saw the bust of Neffertiti and their wonderful Egyptian and Ancient collection) on Museum Island and went to the Deutchbank’s KunstHalle to see the exhibition of their artist of the year (at the recommendation of a co-worker), Basim Magdy. Also walked by the Berlin Cathedral. Met up with Esther for dinner on Zossener Straße and listed to a guitar/blow keyboard duet in the park with the sun setting in the background. We put the remnants of our Euro cents in their guitar case and headed back in the general direction of reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Frieze New York]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frieze highlights:]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/frieze-new-york/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/frieze-new-york/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 01:09:40 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frieze highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through Sunday, July 24, 2016 The Noguchi Museum’s 30th-anniversary programming is marked with an installation by Tom Sachs. This major exhibition is the first at the Museum to present work by a single artist other than Noguchi. The exhibition focuses on an immersive environment representing Sachs’ reworking of &lt;em&gt;chanoyu,&lt;/em&gt; or traditional Japanese tea ceremony—including the various components integral to that ritualistic ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Tom Sachs: Tea Ceremony at The Noguchi Museum?&lt;/strong&gt; A Formal Proof in Noguchi’s Words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I believe in the true development of old traditions.&lt;br&gt;
2. To be hybrid anticipates the future.&lt;br&gt;
3. The future does not belong only to the futurists.&lt;br&gt;
4. Nothing is new, but everything’s new.&lt;br&gt;
5. I like the Japan that I know and want to know, not the Japan that is imposed upon me…I am not about today or yesterday, but only that which is useful to me. Many people live in Japan historically; I don’t.&lt;br&gt;
6. I expect Japan to be the first country to take off as a whole into outer space!&lt;br&gt;
7. Ultimately, I like to think, when you get to the furthest point of technology, when you get to outer space, what do you find to bring back? Rocks!&lt;br&gt;
8. I don’t look at art as something separate and sacrosanct. It’s part of usefulness.&lt;br&gt;
9. Consult NASA.&lt;br&gt;
10. So that art might have the kind of authority that religions have had in getting people to respect and value their part of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1474/25909240623_54e81c9544_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noguchi.org/&quot;&gt;Noguchi.org&lt;/a&gt;: Among the large stone sculptures by Isamu Noguchi in the Museum’s indoor/outdoor galleries, Sachs has set a tea house in a garden accessorized with variations on lanterns, gates, a wash basin, a plywood airplane lavatory, a koi pond, an ultra HD video wall with the sublime hyper-presence of Mt. Fuji, a bronze bonsai made of over 3,600 individually welded parts, and other objects of use and contemplation. Sachs has also produced a complete alternative material culture of Tea—from bowls and ladles, scroll paintings and vases, to a motorized tea whisk, a shot clock, and an electronic brazier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplementing the tea garden are three additional installations covering consummate examples of Sachs’ Tea tools, a brief history of Tea as it developed out of Sachs’ &lt;em&gt;Space Program 2.0: MARS,&lt;/em&gt; and a small retrospective of the artist’s two decade–long career as a cultural hybridizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of the exhibition, Tom Sachs and his friend and colleague in Tea, Johnny Fogg, will perform tea ceremony for two or three guests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Armory Week: Volta Highlights]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/armory-week-volta-highlights/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/armory-week-volta-highlights/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2016 20:18:14 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 529px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1632/25942257825_86569106bc_z.jpg)Anthony Goicolea with Galeria Senda in Barcelona
&lt;/div&gt;During Armory Week I got to visit The Armory Show (thanks to the benevolence of an awesome co-worker who scored me a VIP pass), Volta and SPRING/BREAK. Volta still remains one of my favorite pieces of Armory Week–mostly because of the environment (they somehow manage to achieve a maximum level of tranquility with ample space and the help of a soft grey carpeted floor). I went on Thursday (albeit the day after their free, public Vernissage) and it was such a pleasant experience compared to other experiences this week. SPRING/BREAK has changed a lot since it’s pre-2014 days when it was located in a former Lower East Side school. It has since partnered with Artsy and while it tries to be a homegrown/DIY/curator focused anti-art fair (which, for all intensive purposes, it still is), its increasingly higher-brow patrons looking to ‘see what those kids in Bushwick are up to these days,’ make it feel more and more like the very thing that it tries not to be. While everyone complains that The Armory Show starts to get repetitive after successive years–the same galleries showing the same artists in the exact same booth locations–Volta does a good job at mixing it up and showing a decent sampling of solo projects from emerging international artists. They also try to make the whole experience ‘feel like an intense sequence of studio visits.’

&lt;/div&gt;My favorite booth at Volta this year was Anthony Goicelea’s work with Galeria Senda in Barcelona (pictured above). The works focus of the architecture of the human body to ‘create worlds predicated on fantasy but based in reality.’

&lt;/div&gt;Tim Kent’s works were also particularly awe-inspiring. The pieces splice architecture (construction) with natural elements in order to discuss ‘the threat of encroaching expansion.’

&lt;/div&gt;Abrahim Admed’s work (above) included in the “Something I Can Feel” section curated by Derrick Adams reminded me of the work of Heidi Bucher that I saw at the Swiss Institute in 2014. Bucher’s work took the form of “room skins,” made of latex casts of her parents’ bedroom. Admed’s work also evoked something similar to Do-Ho Suh’s architectural sculptures/installations. Admed’s mixed-media works are supposed to express the feeling of losing a nation as well as one’s identity (before immigrating to Freehold, New Jersey, the artist lived in the Kingdom of Bahrain, Egypt and Kuwait). His work employs cultural symbols and forms of language.

&lt;/div&gt;Then there’s this Amy Schissel work–which is so rad. (Her work confronts the current complex anxieties about the role of painting in the Internet and Information age through the development of immersive painting and video installations).</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panama City and Bocas del Toro]]></title><description><![CDATA[Panama Canal Michael and I just returned from a one week stay in Panama.

&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1475/25066663611_4b4b352a14_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Panama Canal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael and I just returned from a one week stay in Panama. The trip was a great mix of relaxing (in Bocas del Toro), being active and history (visiting the Canal and the biomuseo). We visited the Miraflores locks (pictured above) and saw a few ships passing through. The museum there was definitely lacking and I would recommend going to the off-site museum located in Casco Viejo–although we did not make it there. The Frank Gehry biomuseo, located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, on the Amador Causeway, was very well done and worth seeing for the architecture alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bocas del Toro, a group of nine of us shared a house (Bluff Beach) on Colon Island. The house, which was essentially located right on the beach, was complete with an awesome veranda, pool and fruit trees on the property. The house’s owner also owned a horse farm and a group of us went horseback riding in the jungle with two local guides. During the trek we stopped to swim at Playa La Piscina. The town was basically a beach/surfer town, housing a host of hostels and backpackers. The road leading to the beach house was not paved and the pick up truck taxi cabs had to ford sections of the ocean and tackle rough patches of rocks and beach along the journey. Bocas offers great vibes and there is something nice about the fact that it’s still not completely developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minus a small bought of food poisoning, pretty bland food, the lack of infrastructure, and getting stuck in Panama City when we were supposed to fly out to Bocas the first night–it was a very awesome first experience in Central America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marcel Duchamp, Bicycle Wheel, 1913&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year (and month) mark the 100th anniversary of Marcel Duchamp’s (American, 1887-1968, born France) coining and initial conceptualization of the term ‘readymade.’ Duchamp first used the word “readymade” in a letter dated January 15, 2016 to his sister. Duchamp first topped a kitchen stool with a bicycle wheel in 1913 and this wheel-on-a-stool along with another work &lt;em&gt;Bottle Rack,&lt;/em&gt; 1914 were referenced in the letter to his sister. The original letter read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15th January approximately. My dear Suzanne, A huge thank you for having taken care of everything for me. But why didn’t you take my studio and go and live there? I’ve only just thought of it. Though I think, perhaps, it wouldn’t do for you. In any case, the lease is up 15th July and if you were to renew it, make sure you ask the landlord to let it 3 months at a time, the usual way. He’s bound to agree. Perhaps Father wouldn’t mind getting a term’s rent back if there’s a possibility you’ll be leaving La Condamine by 15th April. But I don’t know anything about your plans and I’m only making a suggestion. Now, if you have been up to my place, you will have seen, in the studio, a bicycle wheel and a bottle rack. I bought this as a ready-made sculpture. And I have a plan concerning this so-called bottle rack. Listen to this: here, in N.Y., I have bought various objects in the same taste and I treat them as “readymades.” You know enough English to understand the meaning of “ready-made” that I give these objects. I sign them and I think of an inscription for them in English. I’ll give you a few examples. I have, for example, a large snow shovel on which I have inscribed at the bottom: &lt;em&gt;In advance of the broken arm&lt;/em&gt;, French translation: &lt;em&gt;En avance du bras casé&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t tear your hair out trying to understand this in the Romantic or Impressionistic or Cubist sense—it has nothing to do with all that. Another “readymade” is called: &lt;em&gt;Emergency in favor of twice&lt;/em&gt;, possible French translation: &lt;em&gt;Danger \ Crise \ en faveur de 2 fois&lt;/em&gt;. This long preamble just to say: take the bottle rack for yourself. I’m making it a “Readymade,” remotely. You are to inscribe it at the bottom and on the inside of the bottom circle, in small letters painted with a brush in oil, silver white color, with an inscription which I will give you herewith, and then sign it, in the same handwriting as follows: [after] Marcel Duchamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/ocgEy0HxvjqHsFXJO20PIw/large.jpg&quot;&gt;Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the construction of &lt;em&gt;Bicycle Wheel,&lt;/em&gt; the artist later recalled “I didn’t have any special reason to do it.” Watching the wheel spin served as a distraction and “was like having a fireplace in the studio, the movement of the wheel reminded me of the movement of the flames.” Duchamp’s bicycle wheel inspired subsequent works such as the now notorious urinal &lt;em&gt;Fountain,&lt;/em&gt; 1917, for which he is primarily known. After this concept spread beyond an intimate circle of artists, it became revolutionary for the course of modern art. The readymade challenged figurative sculpture and the focus on the human body was replaced with the study of industrial material and commercial products. At the same time, Vladimir Tatlin was developing his constructions and there was an ‘increased industrialization and commodification of everyday life.’ (Foster, Krauss, Bois, Buchloh, Joselit, &lt;em&gt;Art Since 1900&lt;/em&gt;). As the narrative goes, Duchamp submitted &lt;em&gt;Fountain&lt;/em&gt; to the American Society of Independent Artists for its first exhibition in April 1917. The show accepted all 2,125 works by 1,235 artists, except for &lt;em&gt;Fountain.&lt;/em&gt; It was derided as vulgar, immoral and plagiarism–a mere piece of plumbing. Originality and intentionality are still questioned in art in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Warhol, Brillo Soap Pads Box, 1964&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duchamp’s work went on to heavily influence Pop, Minimalism, Conceptualism—and his ideas are weigh heavily on the works of canonical contemporary artists such as Robert Rauschenberg to Andy Warhol to Jeff Koons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Everything I've Read in 2015]]></title><description><![CDATA[Here’s the third iteration of my “Everything I’ve Read in 201x.” Goals for this year: read more damn books.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://brevitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/z_feminist.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had high hopes for this collection of essays. When Lena Dunham’s Not That Kind of Girl was sold out in bookstores last Christmas, this was my alternative. Gay dives into contemporary politics and culture, but I found her analyses a little bit shallow and definitely lacking depth. Her works brush the surface and I know that the collection is supposed to be funny and entertaining, but I did not think that it delivered any sort of refreshing commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2oxyu1N3W1rrv3jbo1_500.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This short read uses A. A. Milne’s stories and characters as allegorical devices to explaining the basic tenets of taoism. Pooh’s carefree and simple-minded nature embodies effortless being– the core principle of the Tao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/8117HB7WbvL.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heavy Russian classic about morality. It’s a “courtroom drama” satire, but it’s deeply about family relations. An interesting line and perhaps theme in the novel is that everyone has a secret (or perhaps not-so-secret) desire for their father to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388282563l/20995.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Art of Seduction outlines the art of manipulation and basic psychology/a look into the human psyche. The book catalogues people into different personality types and discusses various seduction techniques to “make people fall under your spell.” I think it’s more useful for the way he labels people into different boxes based on their seduction types and eighteen types of victims than a pick-up-artist guide. Everything comes down to power here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://litbeetle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/the-sun-also-rises.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation,’ post-World War I outlining 1920s Europe from Paris to bullfighting in Spain with a group of expats. A quick-read and prime example of Hemingway’s simple, but effective prose. A great quote from the book: “You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating novel from the author of Love in the Time of Cholera detailing the multi-generational story of the Buendía family. The patriarch/quasi-protagonist in the work, José Arcadio Buendía founds the fictional town of Macondo (metaphoric Colombia). The book weaves the themes of war, love and the the occult together to paint a vivid family portrait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bhagavad Gita&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindu scripture written in verse–a narrative dialogue between Prince Arjuna and his spiritual guide, Lord Krishna. On the brink of war, Krishna coaches Arjuna to ‘fulfill his duty as a warrior and establish Dharma.’&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Frank Stella at the Whitney]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frank Stella may be one of my favorite artists.

&lt;p&gt;Frank Stella may be one of my favorite artists. His minimalist and ‘post-painterly’ works have undoubtedly paved the way for subsequent minimalist and post-minimalist works. The current Stella Retrospective at the Whitney is the most comprehensive to-date and features a wide array of the artist’s works from the 1950s through present. The show diverges from his most well-known works (the Black Series) and presents many lesser-known 3-D pieces from his later works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stormking.org/&quot;&gt;Storm King Art Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was chilly, but it was great fall weather for walking around the property. Currently (and through November 8) Lynda Benglis’s &lt;em&gt;Water Sources&lt;/em&gt; (seen below) is on display as a special exhibition. The works employ her emblematic, iconic materials of latex rubber and polyurethane foam.&lt;/p&gt;

I have also been meaning to visit Sicily, since my mother’s side of the family is from there (and so is Michael’s maternal side of the family). So after a bit of planning this summer, we managed to execute the trip at the end of August. Here’s how it all went down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, August 28&lt;/strong&gt; Our departure from NYC’s JFK. I get ‘randomly’ selected to be questioned and am mildly interrogated by US Homeland Security at our departure gate. (They ask me how much money I’m carrying, what my final destination is, whether or not I have plans to go to Syria and if I have been to Istanbul before–among other things).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5627/21390118199_89fc992841_z.jpg)Blue Mosque
&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, August 29** Our arrival in Istanbul. We stayed in an Airbnb in Sultanahmet (the heart of the touristy area). We met Hamza (our host) at his rug store to pick up our keys and get a brief introduction to the city. He welcomed us with Turkish tea and gave us a map of the city with a few recommendations for what we should cover. After getting settled in (and a nap), we went to the Grand Bazaar and walked over the Galata Bridge. We *hadbalik ekmek* (fish and bread) sandwiches, sold straight from boats in Eminonu Square for only 9 Turkish lira (about $3 USD). At night, we walked over to a hookah bar/restaurant near our apartment for tea and hookah; we had a really friendly Syrian server. We finished the night with a bottle of wine on the rooftop of our Airbnb (that overlooked the city) and a series of checkers games.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5768/21565748312_54535223b5_z.jpg)Istiklal Avenue

&lt;/div&gt;**Sunday, August 30** We checked most of the must-see touristy items off of our list including: The Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern and then we headed over into Beyoglu where we ventured into Taksim Square and walked down Istiklal Avenue (where a lot of Western chain shops are located). We also visited Taksim Gezi park (underwhelming) and went to the Sirkeci train station to see a Whirling Dervishes show. Before the show we visited the New Mosque (which was a lot more peaceful than the Blue Mosque).
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/717/21577050275_724b05d576_z.jpg)Mihrimah Sultan
&lt;/div&gt;**Monday, August 31** We visited the Asian side of Istanbul–took the ferry from Eminou to Kadikoy and happened to randomly run into Klaus and Angela from PS1 who were there for the biennial. We explored the neighborhood of Moda and went to a park on the water there. Also walked through a cemetery on our several mile journey to Uskudar. There we ate an amazing meal at a restaurant called Kanaat Lokantasi. We had lamp, beef, okra, rice and then semolina pound cake topped with *kaymak* (similar to clotted cream). After dinner, we visited the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque–where Michael went in and I sat behind (because women were not allowed to be fully inside and were only allowed to go into a segregated, partitioned section). After taking the ferry back to Eminou, we went to Beyoglu to explore the nightlight a bit (but unfortunately, since it was a Monday, not a lot was happening). We found a great wine bar called Nola and had a glass of wine before eating a fancy McDonald’s dinner (since nothing else was opened at 2:30 am). I had a McChicken and Michael had a Big Mac and fries.

&lt;/div&gt;**Tuesday, September 1** Our last day in Istanbul–we visited the Istanbul Modern and had an amazing brunch at a little place in the backstreets of Karakoy near the museum. The rest of this day was spent in a frenzied state as we navigated our way to the Istanbul airport, to Rome, barely caught our connecting flight to Palermo (due to delays) and the arrived too late to get our rental car to Linguaglossa (so we had to get a hotel in Palermo for a night).
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/715/20954693984_26efe54140_z.jpg)Autostrada
&lt;/div&gt;**Wednesday, September 2** Woke up in Palermo–made our way back to the airport, picked up our Fiat Panda rental car (it was an awesome little car) and drove to Linguaglossa on the east coast. Unfortunately we got there pretty late (around 5 p.m.) and only had a short period of time in our amazing Airbnb (it was on a farm property with fig trees, grape vines, over 500 species of cacti, tomatoes, etc., etc.) belonging to a couple–the husband was from Linguaglossa and the wife was American. Our guesthouse was stocked with homemade olive oil and wine and we went into town to pick up some things to make dinner. Went to sleep pretty early–exhausted from our entire day + of travel.

&lt;/div&gt;**Thursday, September 3** Not sure how we managed to pack it all in–but we departed from Linguaglossa, drove to Messina (because that’s the town where my grandfather was from and I wanted to see it), went to the Duomo there, stopped in Taormina (went to the Greek amphitheater there), drove down to Agrigento to the Valley of the Temples, then met up with our Airbnb host in Palermo. Exhausted from all of travel (again) we called it an early night. Palermo was pretty dirty–a lot of garbage/litter/dog poop everywhere.

&lt;/div&gt;**Friday, September 4** Our beach day. Went to San Vito and the Zingaro Nature Reserve. Breath taking views and amazing swimming.

&lt;/div&gt;**Saturday, September 5** Our last day/night in Sicily. We visited the Monte Pellegrino and went to the shrine of St. Rosalia Palermo cathedral (and went on the roof), saw the catacombs (super dark, super disturbing), and briefly went to Monreale to see the church there. Went to dinner near our apartment at a place called Cin Cin. Mourned the end of our trip and our imminent return to real life/New York City.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, September 6&lt;/strong&gt; Our (sad) return to the States.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Austin and Marfa]]></title><description><![CDATA[I finally made it down to Texas after Austin and Marfa have been on my shortlist for a little while.

&lt;p&gt;I finally made it down to Texas after Austin and Marfa have been on my shortlist for a little while. My s.o., Michael, had a conference in Austin and invited me to tag along. Here’s a play-by-play of our 4 night trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1, Friday&lt;/strong&gt;: Arrived in Austin around 9:15 p.m. and went out on West 6th Street. Our Uber driver kindly explained that 6th Street is where the under 21 crowd with fake IDs go when frequenting bars and obliteration is still this novel, crazy thing; West 6th Street is when you’re around 22-23 and you’ve been legally drinking for a bit, and are ready to grow up a bit/a chance of pace; and then Rainey Street is for the more mature crowd. I guess I fall into that last cohort, ugh. We went to a bar called J. Black’s and then one called The Corral–which totally lived up to its namesake. Ended the night eating street tacos and drinking coconut water while sitting on a concrete partition outside of a closed bar (bars close at 2:00 am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2, Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;: Met up with my cousin and his wife and their Japanese house guest for lunch at Torchys Tacos and then they took us to Farewell Books–this really rad book/coffee/secondhand/art shop. Michael and I proceeded to check out South Congress and went to Uncommon Objects–an antique and vintage shop, and some other book shops and got ice cream. Got dinner at this rad Thai place, Sway and then went out on Rainey. Met up with my high school friend, Darcy who happened to be in town. Darcy and I have this weird thing where we randomly meet up in different cities that we happen to be visiting at the same time (i.e. Rome, New Orleans and now, Austin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/349/20451839106_b4ace53582_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3, Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;: Woke up pretty early and drove 6+ hours to Marfa from Austin. Marfa Population: 2,121. Went to the Chinati Foundation, saw the Donald Judd aluminum and concrete works (unfortunately–didn’t get to see the entire campus because the day-long guided tours all start early), drove to Prada, Marfa and then got pizza in the adjacent town of Alpine (because, apparently, everything in Marfa is closed on the weekends). Proceeded to drive back to Austin. Almost ran over an armadillo. Didn’t die. Checked into our new hotel at 1:00 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4, Monday&lt;/strong&gt;: Spent some time at the pool and went kayaking on Lady Bird Lake. Michael had a business dinner and I met up with Andrew and Tessia and got dinner at Second Bar and Kitchen and then got frozen yogurt. Afterwards, Michael and I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cheerupcharlies.com/&quot;&gt;Cheer Up Charlies&lt;/a&gt; and saw a rad band called play on Monday night, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU9vpZIaxl0&quot;&gt;Besos de Lobos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/483/20289964310_95f1bb3b08_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5, Tuesday&lt;/strong&gt;: Went to the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas. They actually have a pretty amazing collection (from Renaissance through contemporary). They had a Caribbean exhibition featuring Puerto Rican artist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/impressionism_and_the_caribbean&quot;&gt;Francisco Oller&lt;/a&gt; and a Brother’s Grimm-inspired exhibition of Natalie Frank’s gouache and pastel drawings. Spent the rest of the day by the pool before our flight back to NY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zoe Leonard: Analogue]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is extremely lazy, but (from MoMA.org): Analogue, by Zoe Leonard (American, b. 1961), is a landmark project comprising 412 photographs…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/zoe-leonard-analogue/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/zoe-leonard-analogue/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 04:33:48 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/516/19886792840_5f1cf77465_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is extremely lazy, but (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1527&quot;&gt;MoMA.org&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogue&lt;/em&gt;, by Zoe Leonard (American, b. 1961), is a landmark project comprising 412 photographs conceived over the course of a decade. Displayed in serial grids and organized into 25 chapters, &lt;em&gt;Analogue&lt;/em&gt; documents the eclipsed texture of 20th-century urban life as seen in vanishing mom-and-pop stores and the simultaneous emergence of the global rag trade. Leonard took her own New York neighborhood, Manhattan’s Lower East Side, as a point of departure in the late 1990s. She then followed the circulation of recycled merchandise—used clothing, discarded advertisements, and the old technology of Kodak camera shops—to far-flung markets in Africa, Eastern Europe, Cuba, Mexico, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappearing storefronts and neglected products are echoed in the obsolete technology the artist used to reproduce them: a vintage 1940s Rolleiflex camera, a tool “left over from the mechanical age,” as Leonard put it, along with gelatin silver and chromogenic printing processes. Tapping the traditions of documentary and conceptual photography, &lt;em&gt;Analogue&lt;/em&gt; is positioned in the genealogy of grand visual archives that extends from Eugène Atget’s compendium of Paris to Martha Rosler’s photo-text work on New York’s Bowery. Leonard’s project is an urgent document and a poetic allegory of globalization that reveals the circulation of goods and the homogenization of diverse geographical locations in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own crappy words: There’s some beauty about capturing things as they fade into obsolescence. It especially resonates for me because I worked a bit on the Kodak bankruptcy/restructuring case–so here all of my worlds are colliding as these photos are plastered to the walls of my new workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Leonard: &lt;em&gt;Analogue&lt;/em&gt; runs through August 30, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Philippe Parreno H {N)Y P N(Y} OSIS at the Park Avenue Armory]]></title><description><![CDATA[Installation, light, video, performance and sound components all play into Philippe Parreno’s work filling the space at the Park Avenue…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/philippe-parreno-h-ny-p-ny-osis-at-the-park-avenue-armory/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/philippe-parreno-h-ny-p-ny-osis-at-the-park-avenue-armory/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2015 01:54:48 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3720/18996320292_81c92264f2_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation, light, video, performance and sound components all play into Philippe Parreno’s work filling the space at the Park Avenue Armory. It’s a completely immersive experience that is unique to each viewer (the exhibition will be at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/philippe_parreno&quot;&gt;the Armory through August 2&lt;/a&gt;) and I’d recommend giving yourself at least two hours if your goal is to watch all of the video art that comprises the installation. A cylindrical contraption, that acts as seating in the space, holds viewers and slowly rotates following the videos and the periodic light/sound pieces. Somewhat meta in nature due to the content of some videos, the piece really makes you contemplate your very own presence/placement within the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the opportunity to help out a bit with an exhibition that took place at the amazing Skylight at the Moynihan Station space during Frieze Week. I also had the opportunity to attend Frieze, which was great, but a lot of the same old galleries producing their standard fare (with some exceptions and while I appreciated their initiatives to be interactive Gagosian producing Richard Prince’s Instagram prints and selling them for $100,000 a piece doesn’t really do it for me). So–the gallery I am currently doing a bit of freelancing/consulting for–Denis Gardarin Gallery–put on an exhibition from May 13-16. The show displayed 7 of French conceptual artist Mathieu Mercier’s paintings “Diamants,” which, close-up appear to be abstract, but from far away look like diamonds. They really fit well into the old post office space and the evening light during the opening was absolutely fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little brother, John, just graduated from Loyola University in New Orleans three weeks ago. Having been there three times now, I can honestly see myself moving there at some point. My one regret about this trip: (ok, two) I wish I saw more art (and took more time to scout out the galleries on Royal Street) and I wish I listened to more live music. John did take me to ExhibitBE–an amazing work of outdoor graffiti that covers unoccupied five-story buildings. Sort of what 5-Pointz was to Queens/Long Island City, ExhibitBE is to NoLA. A true celebration of street art–I present here, some of the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a three year old cat I adopted from the ASPCA when I first moved to New York. He’s a black cat and his name is Cesare after Cesare Borgia. Naturally, I’m a cat (and overall, an animal) lover and this exhibition, brought to my attention by a fellow Sotheby’s alum, clearly appealed to my interests. The selection of (mostly) Edo woodblock prints were whimsical and combined myth and folklore with history and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japansociety.org/event/life-of-cats-selections-from-the-hiraki-ukiyo-e-collection&quot;&gt;Japan Society’s&lt;/a&gt; press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since arriving in Japan aboard Japanese ships transporting sacred Buddhist scriptures from China in the mid-sixth century, cats have proceeded to purr and paw their way into the heart of Japanese life, folklore, and art. &lt;em&gt;Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection&lt;/em&gt; illustrates the depth of this mutual attraction by mining the wealth of bravura depictions of cats to be found in ukiyo-e woodblock prints of the Edo Period (1615-1867). The exhibition is divided into five sections: Cats and People, Cats as People, Cats versus People, Cats Transformed and Cats and Play. 90 ukiyo-e prints in the exhibition are on loan from the esteemed Hiraki Ukiyo-e Foundation whose holdings are revered in Japan. Select prints, paintings, sculptures, and other works borrowed from U.S. collections complement these prints, making the exhibition over 120 artworks. With cross-cultural and multi-generational appeal, &lt;em&gt;Life of Cats&lt;/em&gt; takes viewers on a wild ride through Japan’s love affair with our feline friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Armory Arts week always feels like a game of bingo–you’re tasked with checking off as much as possible in a very finite amount of time and it can become very overwhelming if you’re playing with multiple cards (or if you have any semblance of a job–especially one of the full-time nature). Another analogy I’ve heard it likened to is Disney World–like a futile attempt to hit all of the different parks in only a few days’ time. It’s virtually impossible/insane to see everything that the Armory Show and accompanying satellite fairs (ADAA, Volta, Pulse, Scope, Art on Paper, Independent, Spring/Break, (Un)Scene, etc.) have to offer in the less than a week time block. This year I managed to hit The Armory Show, Volta, (Un)Scene, and Spring/Break. Volta has remained my favorite show for the second year in a row because of it’s organization (it moved to Pier 90–adjacent to The Armory Show this year) and it’s accessibility to the art–one of the best features is the leaflets with descriptions of the artwork that each booth offers. Other highlights included free Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s (and admission) at (Un)Scene and the former post-office/Herald Square location of Spring/Break (which was formally housed in a old Catholic school).
&lt;p&gt;Any who–here are my favorite pieces from Volta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;So the biggest caveat of writing about the Chris Ofili exhibition: Night and Day at the New Museum (albeit somewhat delayed) is that I was unable to capture the best pieces in the show (the pieces in the “Night” section) because, as you could imagine, it was dark as hell in there. Words never do artwork justice–but the third floor which was dedicated to a body of work inspired by the “Blue Devils”–a Trinidadian reference from Carnival that also represents a political reference to police and their relationship with black men. The exhibition as a whole was moving and Ofili (recipient of the Tuner prize and embroiled in controversy when former major Giuliani chastised his “The Holy Virgin Mary” painting in 1999) lives up to his reputation as the contemporary Gauguin. Ofili is notorious for using elephant dung in his work. His paintings are vibrant, sensual, emotional, and thought-provoking.

&lt;p&gt;So after somewhat of a self-imposed mini hiatus from the art world, I’m picking back up. I managed to catch the ZERO exhibit at the Guggenheim in its second to last day before closing. The historical survey focused on the German artists’ group ZERO (1957-66) that was founded by Heinz Mack and Otto Piene and later tapped into a network of artists from Europe, Japan, and North and South American (among them: Lucio Fontana, Yves Klein, Yayoi Kusama, and Piero Manzoni to name a few). The group’s aim was to redefine art in the aftermath of World War II and go against the typical art of Europe at the time. The group mixes elements of Land art, Minimalism, Arte Povera and Conceptual art across a broad range of materials. The most striking part of the exhibition was the group’s ability to traverse geographic bounds in order to come together and create something with a common goal in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. The Lonely Polygamist by Brady Udall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A fictional chronicle of one man’s breakdown with the background noise of 4 wives and 28 kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/0/573/2307500/Object%20of%20Beauty_1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. An Object of Beauty by Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A novel about one young woman’s grooming at Sotheby’s and subsequent art world ladder climbing in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41M-rPSHLlL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Just Kids by Patti Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A pretty emotional read. Patti Smith’s firsthand account of her relationship and friendship with Robert Maplethorpe through his battle with AIDS and their struggle in New York City and life at the Chelsea Hotel in the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nktefAZTL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Seven Days in the Art World by Sarah Thornton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A similar read to the $12 Million Stuffed Shark by Don Thompson, though a bit outdated (published in 2008), this book outlines the basics of the contemporary art world–from fairs to collectors to the secondary market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sorrytelevision.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/527141df7cd2b-preview-300.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;5. The Goldfinch&lt;/strong&gt; Though a bit of a long read, an excellent and emotional contemporary coming of age tale taking place mostly in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/loveundetectable_sullivan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;6. Love Undetectable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book’s author, Andrew Sullivan, an HIV positive homosexual writing with Christian perspectives and ideals in mind, employs the use of three separate essays to discuss love, relationships and friendship. For me, despite the religious discussion throughout, the overall message still resonated. Best take home message: Romantic love is possible because of friendship, which tends to be more stable with the former having a larger tendency to be in flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;7. Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet by Sidney D. Kirkpatrick&lt;/strong&gt; This one is a bit out there, but a man I talked to on a flight back in June from JFK to Milan recommended this (and a whole list of books on theosophy) to me. It’s a fantastic biography about the life and work of Edgar Cayce, who was a psychic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the ability to answer questions about reincarnation, healing and other topics while in trance. An interesting read, but it drags a bit at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;8. Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&lt;/strong&gt; Someone at a Bushwich open studios party recommended this one to me. Great coming of age novel about a young non-American black woman and her struggle with the issue of race. It’s also a love story, but that’s definitely secondary to other more over-arching themes in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hong Kong]]></title><description><![CDATA[Now for the next trip…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/hong-kong/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/hong-kong/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 15:17:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8626/15866265751_4a2e931185_z.jpg)Market on Hong Kong Island
&lt;/div&gt;I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to go to Hong Kong for two weeks at the end of October/beginning of November after finishing my thesis. It’s always been a city I’ve wanted to visit and there’s so much to see amidst the organized chaos and convergence of east and west. I found it really easy to navigate the public transportation system, even though it’s a bit overwhelming at first. The MTR is so clean and everyone queues up in an orderly single-file line to get onto the trains. There’s also this weird robotic quality to the whole MTR experience because of the number of escalators and arrows you have to follow on the floors, while everyone is deeply entranced by their huge Samsung phones. The Hong Kong tramway (or “ding ding”), the buses and the ferries are also super easy to use. The ferry from HK island to Kowloon is also an iconic ride.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8632/15682538307_051a77a7ee_z.jpg)Big Buddha, Lantau Island
&lt;/div&gt;**Week 1**: I stayed on Des Voeux Road West with my friend, Chris, who works in HK, which is in the dry seafood district in the Sheung Wan neighborhood on Hong Kong Island. My first full day there (Wednesday, October 29), I explored HK island and went to Western Market (they mostly sell fabrics there) and wandered along Hollywood Road where there are a bunch of antique galleries and neat little shops. Thursday, I met Chris in Wan Chai for lunch near his office for Malaysian food and then I went to the Hong Kong history museum. It’s a great museum and takes you through the details of the SAR’s natural history and pre-historical settlements, up through contemporaneity. Friday, Chris took off from work and we went to Victoria Peak together via the tram and then we did a bit of hiking at the top. Obviously a must-see for any HK visit. Saturday, we went to see the Big Buddha on Lantau Island via a cable car and then went into Kowloon and walked along the Avenue of the Stars. Sunday was a rest/movie/peanut butter and noodle bowl day. Monday we went to the HK art museum, which was a bit underwhelming because they were in between installations and so it was pretty sparse. The following Tuesday, I went to Mongkok to check out the umbrella revolution/occupy HK protests. Lots of tents blocking the streets, but there weren’t a ton of people there and everything was peaceful. I also went to the Ladies’ Market to get some gifts, which is an iconic market that sells clothes and jewelry and the likes. From there I headed to Tsim Sha Shui (TST) to Nathan Road to see Chungking Mansions, which is supposed to have the cheapest tourist accommodations and known for it’s gathering of South Asian minorities (Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans and Nepalese). I was warned that it was a bit sketchy there and being alone made it a little bit more so. After wandering briefly and two different probably innocuous incidents where people got too close to comfort and touching (nothing wildly inappropriate), I decided to leave.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7558/15866361701_1800600836_z.jpg)Occupy Hong Kong, Mongkok
&lt;/div&gt;**Week 2**: Wednesday, November 5, I went into the New Territories to walk the Ping Shan heritage trail. There were a bunch of old temples and old study halls and HK’s only remaining ancient pagoda and it was all through a small little town. Thursday, I went to Lamma Island and hiked for several hours. There are amazing views and since it’s a fishing village, there are great seafood restaurants by the pier (Rainbow Seafood is renowned in the area). Lamma is also home to really large, terrible spiders. Friday, I met Chris near his office and got lunch at a place called Life Cafe and then I went to the Dr. Sun Yat Sun museum. Saturday it rained so it was a rest day. Sunday we went to Stanley Bay to walk around–there’s a small beach there and a market and bunch of restaurants. on the water. Monday (my last full day in HK), we went into Macau–went into the Grand Lisbon and saw the ruins of St. Paul and the Old Fort and then took a bus to Taipa Old Town and ate at a Portuguese restaurant. To be honest (especially because I don’t gamble) Macau wasn’t too noteworthy. The architecture was cool, but there was a bit of a dingy, grey aesthetic to the whole place (it was also an overcast day, so there was that as well).

&lt;/div&gt;Although it’s a big international financial city with such a large ex-pat population, I think that it lacks that misery that underscores life in New York City. I may also be mistaken because I was merely a visitor looking in from the outside, but the abundance of opportunities to do something outdoors (hiking, etc.) and the geography of the archipelago and topography of the islands seemed to take the edge off of the proliferation of designer brand stores and financial establishments in Central. While there is hardly any crime there and I felt super safe the entire time I was exploring, [the murder of two Indonesian women by a British banker](http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-grisly-hong-kong-murders-spark-banker-backlash-2014-11) occurred during my stay. It is a strange city where money affords ex-pats the opportunities to indulge into their respective vices (drinking, partying, hookers, cocaine, etc.) and Wan Chai is known for its seedy bars and sex workers. I would also like to think that this ex-pat culture doesn’t completely overshadow the rich cultural history of the SAR.

&lt;p&gt;October was dedicated to finishing my thesis (titled: SYNERGY AND JOINT AUTHORSHIP THROUGH SOCIALISM: Exploring the Practices and Work of Post-Mao, Contemporary Chinese Artistic Collectives) and finishing up my masters program at Sotheby’s. The whole process was grueling/rewarding. I learned a lot about contemporary Chinese art, which was my initial aim and I got to research a lot of artworks that were outside of the parameters of my program’s basic curriculum. It was a great way to wrap up my grad school experience, although it was a bit draining at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15636128670_df93d61030_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Shao Yinong and Mu Chen, The Assembly Hall—Yangjialing, 2002&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trajectory of contemporary Chinese art has a drastically different arc than that of its Western counterparts. In the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, artists working in China today are still attempting to reconcile their conceptions of identity in contemporaneity. There has been a persistent Western inclination to celebrate the artist as a “genius creator,” and praise the unique art object while condemning the copy. Since these capitalist notions, rooted in copyright law, previously had no basis in China, copying practices and the active embracement of a collective past have long been prominent in Chinese art. Using the art of contemporary Chinese collectives while comparing and contrasting their work and practices with those of both Russian collectives, coming from a similar socialist background, and Western collectives, this study examines the objectives of contemporary Chinese artists working—under joint authorship—through socialism in the context of our current state of late global capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7543/15797305396_f2137d0e16_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Wang Guangyi, Coca Cola, from Great Criticism Series, 2004&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I reached was a bit grim, but it was basically (in a nutshell) that these contemporary Chinese artists were working as collectives in order to work through the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution and art making in tandem served a cathartic purpose AND that the art market is basically feeding into this singular, international monoculture. I framed my argument in the context of Chinese copyright law (China adapted its own version of Western copyright law in order to comply with the WTO so that it would be able to be admitted for trading purposes) and the Buddhist/Confucian views of the copy. I also argued against the concept of the artist as a genius, or some divine creator who creates singular art objects. In Buddhism, copying scripture gains one merit and copying practices, say for the sake of repetition of a mantra, are glorified. For Confucius, an individual’s awareness of this past was integral to understanding how to properly adhere to these fundamental relationships. That’s only scratching the surface of it all, but contact me if you’d actually like to hear more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jacob Hashimoto: Skyfarm Fortress]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/jacob-hashimoto-skyfarm-fortress/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/jacob-hashimoto-skyfarm-fortress/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 23:24:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15158929589_a9831c5665_z.jpg)Skyfarm Fortress, Jacob Hashimoto at Mary Boone
&lt;/div&gt;*Skyfarm Fortress*, currently on view at Mary Boone in Chelsea, is a handmade sculpture made from wood, paper, and string. This is the East Coast counterpart to Hashimoto’s *Gas Giant,* that open at LA MOCA’s Pacific Design Center in March 2014. Employing the artist’s signature bamboo and paper “kites” that play on his Japanese heritage, *Gas Giant* offered an enveloping environment to explore.

&lt;/div&gt;This summer was supposed to be dedicated to thesis research and writing. Instead I took a bit of an academic hiatus, hightailed it to Italy for a week in June, backpacked a bit through Thailand with my brother in July and then came back and started to piece my domestic life back together in August. So here I am, thousands of frequent flier miles later, post-sun tan, post-summer vacation, post-health insurance, still trying to get it together. While I sit in NYU’s Bobst library on a Saturday night during Labor Day weekend, eating Goldfish, thinking about my next globe trotting adventure, instead of finishing the book I’m currently reading (The Third Hand, by Charles Green) for my thesis, I’m dedicating a blog post to the little bit of what I’ve nailed down so far.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thesis Topic&lt;/strong&gt;: Collaborative Contemporary Chinese Art&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chinese Artists&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamen&lt;/strong&gt;: (Work pictured above). Chen Li, Lai Shengyu and Yang Xiaogang function as a collective known as Tamen (meaning “&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;” in Mandarin). Known for “wacky” and kitschy contemporary scenes juxtaposing Eastern and Western Culture (as in their “Same Room Series”) they oscillate between painting and photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 645px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5568/15085410491_5bb256ea86_z.jpg)Birdhead, From The Song of Early Spring, 2012
&lt;/div&gt;**Birdhead**: The Shanghai duo formed by Song Tao and Ji Weiyu in 2004 work in the photographic medium capturing the everyday documentary images of their city employing a post-punk aesthetic.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3865/15065531386_18d0b5926b_z.jpg)The Luo Brothers, Welcome the World Famous Brand Name, 1993-94
&lt;/div&gt;**The Luo Brothers**: Classified as Political Pop, these three brothers from Beijing mock the Eastern consumption of Western brands (such as Coca-cola) by incorporating acid colors, impish Chinese babies and depictions of Chairman Mao.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3887/14901940510_f246dbe5d5_z.jpg)Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, Old Persons Home, 2007
&lt;/div&gt;**Sun Yuan &amp;amp; Peng Yu**: These guys a probably my favorite collective because they’re the most outlandish and may be the “most controversial artists working in China today” (says multiple sources). This duo based in Beijing, deals with conceptual art and work in installation and performance art. They’ve incorporated live animals (fish, crustations, dogs), baby cadavers, among other things in their works. In *Old Persons Home,* shown at the Saatchi Gallery in London, the duo used motorized wheelchairs with hyperrealistic silicon sculptures made in the likeness of elderly folks who were supposed to represent the U.N. (dead). The wheelchairs were placed on an automatic setting at a very low speed and were sent on a collision course, bumper-car style.
&lt;p&gt;So what I’m trying to explore here is what exactly is achieved through collaborative efforts by these artists working in a post-Cultural Revolution, post-Mao, post-open trade contemporary China. As a point of comparison, I will also incorporate works by Russian and Western collectives. I originally wanted to explore Chinese art because contemporary art is taught (at least in my program) as being fairly Western-centric and while BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) countries are incorporated to a small extent, there are tremendous gaps in my knowledge about Chinese contemporary art. The idea for my thesis was also spurred by the premise that Burning Man was founded on– the idea of working together to produce art instead of perpetuating the artist as genius idea.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thailand]]></title><description><![CDATA[I don’t know if I can really begin to put my trip to Thailand into words–but I’ll attempt to.

The trip was planned and finalized during the spring when my brother, John, and I decided that we wanted to travel together. I had never been to Asia before and Thailand was pretty high up on my list of places to visit. I went for just over two weeks and John continued on to Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore. Now I’m back in New York and I have to complete my thesis before I can even think about planning my next trip (but hopefully I’ll manage to swing something in the fall/winter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit about each of the cities we visited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3859/14541578277_05643f447e_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been apprehensive about visiting Bangkok because it had mixed reviews from people who have visited before, but I really enjoyed what the capital city had to offer. We could have used a bit more time to explore since we were only here for 3 nights and didn’t get in until around midnight, but in that time we managed to pack in The Grand Palace, Wat Arun, Chinatown and Khaosan Road. The Grand Palace was a must-see, Wat Arun was difficult to get to, but had great views, Chinatown was fun to explore and the food was great–but not fantastic as far as big city Chinatowns go and Khaosan Road was an experience–fun to visit and even though it’s the backpackers road I definitely would not recommend staying there because of the noise/chaos. It’s a bit like Bourbon Street in New Orleans–fun for the spectacle and a must-see at least once while you’re there, but it doesn’t offer a truly local and authentic experience of the city. The bars blast competing EDM that results in a terrible cacophony, while men and woman try to get you to see ping-pong shows and vendors sell street food, cheap clothing, fake sunglasses and watches and bugs and scorpions for consumption. Our hostel was in Siam Square, right near the skytrain–which made it easy to get to the airport and the river, but there’s also a lot that the skytrain line doesn’t reach (you could transfer to a ferry to get to Wat Arun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5594/14541575327_4182440b67_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chiang Mai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiang Mai was definitely my favorite stop on the trip. The food was amazing and cheap (a whole dinner of stewed pork leg from a street vendor cost 30 Baht–or less than $1), our hostel/guesthouse experience was great and allowed us to meet a lot of cool people, the surrounding area is beautiful, the 2-day trekking adventure we arranged through the hostel and we got 1 hour Thai massages for 180 Baht ($5.66 USD). Our trekking trip (1400 Baht or $44.98 USD), which included food, transportation, a tour of an orchid/butterfly farm, elephant trekking/feeding, an overnight stay with the Lahu hill tribe, a couple waterfall excursions, whitewater rafting and bamboo rafting, was the highlight of the trip. The overnight stay with the hill tribe after a full day of trekking was what finally got me to relax and enter full vacation mode–which is sometimes hard when there’s a lot on your mind from back home. Our guide (a cheeky Thai man named Don, who was married to a British woman and loved using strange English phrases, like many Thais do) and tribe mother cooked us dinner after we showered with cold bucket water and we ate with our temporary family for the stay. After dinner, we drank and played stick games and were serenaded by Don, who played us a bunch of Western songs (he knew about 1/4 of the words and just mumbled the rest) including “No Woman, No Cry,” “Wonderwall,” “Hey, Jude,” “Zombie,” “Numa, Numa,” “Hotel California,” and “Take Me Home, Country Roads.” Unfortunately (or perhaps in an act of fate), after our trip and return to Chiang Mai, it was Buddhist holiday and all the bars were closed for the following two days. John and I explored some of the local temples, got massages from “ex-prisoners” and hung out and drank shitty Thai beer (Chang and Leo) and played cards (President, mostly) with people from our hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14541377258_bb77a87ef3_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koh Phi Phi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mistakingly booked 5-nights in Koh Phi Phi, which John and I frantically changed to three after our arrival and realization that Koh Phi Phi was a terribly-overpriced tourist trap/non-stop bro party. It was pretty crappy getting to Koh Phi Phi after such an awesome time in Chiang Mai because the food was disappointing, there wasn’t as much to do, and there was bit of a weird, eerie and hazy overcast dampening the mood as well. The experience overall was redeemed, in the end. Our hostel was at the top of a terrible series of stairs, next to the Tsunami evacuation and lookout point. John did happen to run into a friend from school and his traveling buddy so we got to hang out with them one night and went to a great, chill spot called Banana Bar where they play movies and 90s hip-hop music videos on screens. They also have a great rooftop and a lot of cozy cushions. We booked a day-trip to the surrounding islands that included a bunch of surrounding spots, snorkeling and Maya Bay (where the movie, The Beach was filmed). Maya Bay was breath-taking and worth the entire trip–you had to swim, climb a rope wall and venture across the island to actually get to the beach. Our last night in Phi Phi, John and I went to Reggae Bar, which is actually just a big boxing ring that hosts Muay Thai matches AND (the best part) matches between eager testosterone-amped tourists (with the incentive of a free bucket). You may accuse me of lacking class, but watching drunk bros voluntarily kick the shit out of each other is awesome. John made friends with two Brits sitting next to us who introduced him to betel nut (or Maht, in Thai).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2896/14541378728_0af67def28_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koh Lanta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh Lanta was a nice escape after the chaos of Phi Phi. It was quiet and pretty deserted because it’s the off-season there now. Our hostel owner was a very friendly and helpful Swiss man who married a Thai woman from Koh Lanta. A couple nights was enough time to explore the 30 km long island and we rented a motorbike to venture around. We were within walking distance of one of the island’s several beaches, Long Beach and we biked to the national park where we saw a bunch of monkeys and a short hiking trail that led to a small waterfall. The food was a lot better than in Phi Phi and the prices a bit better too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3874/14747886293_67fbea0f9f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Phuket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three nights in Phuket were three nights too many. We stayed in Patong Beach, which is like the worst of Jersey + Vegas all wrapped up into one trashy, touristy, pricey, awful place. The worst part is the prevalence of old, usually fat, western guys with Thai hookers. John and I ventured to a little bit outside of Patong where we found a Thai/Chinese seafood restaurant, which became our safe haven for all three nights. Highlight of Phuket: Meeting up with our friend Ian we met in Chiang Mai who stayed at our hostel + went on the trekking trip with us. The beach wasn’t terrible, but there was a lot of garbage everywhere. John went parasailing and we took a bus into Phuket Town one day to escape the awfulness that is Patong. While there wasn’t much to do there, it was good to get a good local meal and be away from Patong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended the trip in Bangkok with a 12-hour layover after Phuket and had the pleasure of meeting up with a friend (Chris) I met in Chiang Mai who happened to be house-sitting with his Aussie friend at the time. It was great to meet up again, catch up and not have to kill all of that time at BKK. We had a couple of beers, hung out with the two house cats, and got a fabulous Thai dinner. Wonderful ending to a wonderful trip.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeff Koons at The Whitney]]></title><description><![CDATA[It was well curated, the space was well used and it was an interesting survey of one artist’s body of work, my issue with it was not liking…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/p649/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/p649/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 23:16:59 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was well curated, the space was well used and it was an interesting survey of one artist’s body of work, my issue with it was not liking specific pieces in the show rather than the show as a whole.

&lt;/div&gt;I’ve had the pleasure of visiting Venice for the second time within the past year for the 14th annual International Architecture Exhibition, curated by Rem Koolhaas, held from June 7 through November 23 at the Giardini and Arsenale venues in Venice. The theme of this year’s exhibition was “Fundamentals,” and according to Rem, it “looks at histories, tries to reconstruct how architecture finds itself in its current situation, and speculates on its future.”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14464698164_d99bce24e3_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three interlocking exhibitions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;**1) Absorbing Modernity: 1914-2014** (Giardini: National Pavilions), 65 national pavilions explore modernization and show “a radical splintering of modernities in a century where the homogenization process of globalization appeared to be the master narrative.”

&lt;/div&gt;**2) Monditalia** (Arsenale: Also, for the first time, Venice’s other biennales and festivals including dance, music, theatre and film collaborate with architecture), Italy is looked at as a “fundamental” country, combining 82 films, 41 architectural projects while merging architecture with dance, music and theatre. These exhibitions work to explore and form a “comprehensive portrait” of Italy. The architectural projects explore issues such as national borders, aspects of culture and geography.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Elements of Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; (Giardini, Central Pavilion), the fundamentals of buildings (floor, wall, ceiling, roof, door, window, façade, balcony, corridor, fireplace, toilet, stairs, escalator, elevator and ramp) are all examined throughly. My favorite part of this exhibition was the movie titled “Elements” by Davide Rapp, that, reminiscent of Christian Marclay’s “The Clock,” use vignettes from films to compile sections dedicated to one specific element of architecture.&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;For some reason, I was expecting not to like the Italian Futurism exhibit at the Guggenheim–but I was pleasantly surprised. I think it was because I most often associate Futurism with machines and war and imperialism and cubism. What I appreciated most was the very obvious surrealist influence on many of the works (including a series of photocollages by Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni).

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Courage, audacity, and revolt will be essential elements of our poetry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to now literature has exalted a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and sleep. We intend to exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the racer’s stride, the mortal leap, the punch and the slap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We affirm that the world’s magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of explosive breath—a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to hymn the man at the wheel, who hurls the lance of his spirit across the Earth, along the circle of its orbit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The poet must spend himself with ardor, splendor, and generosity, to swell the enthusiastic fervor of the primordial elements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except in struggle, there is no more beauty. No work without an aggressive character can be a masterpiece. Poetry must be conceived as a violent attack on unknown forces, to reduce and prostrate them before man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We stand on the last promontory of the centuries!… Why should we look back, when what we want is to break down the mysterious doors of the Impossible? Time and Space died yesterday. We already live in the absolute, because we have created eternal, omnipresent speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will glorify war—the world’s only hygiene—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind, will fight moralism, feminism, every opportunistic or utilitarian cowardice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will sing of great crowds excited by work, by pleasure, and by riot; we will sing of the multicolored, polyphonic tides of revolution in the modern capitals; we will sing of the vibrant nightly fervor of arsenals and shipyards blazing with violent electric moons; greedy railway stations that devour smoke-plumed serpents; factories hung on clouds by the crooked lines of their smoke; bridges that stride the rivers like giant gymnasts, flashing in the sun with a glitter of knives; adventurous steamers that sniff the horizon; deep-chested locomotives whose wheels paw the tracks like the hooves of enormous steel horses bridled by tubing; and the sleek flight of planes whose propellers chatter in the wind like banners and seem to cheer like an enthusiastic crowd.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2014/03/17/140317craw_artworld_schjeldahl&quot;&gt;Peter Schjeldahl&lt;/a&gt; called this year’s Whitney Biennial a “frazzled, peculiarly melancholy Zeitgeist,” I think that label seems a bit too harsh. When assembling a comprehensive body of work that large how can one really avoid frazzledness? I think that it accomplished its aims–typifying contemporaneity and providing a semblance of “the art world today,” which is not an easy feat. The Biennial was curated according to floor, each one with a different curator and mission statement. I don’t think it was a coincident that all of my tops picks were from the same floor–the third floor curated by Stuart Comer whose attempt was to “provide a kaleidoscopic glimpse of this historic moment.” Comer utilized a variety of different mediums, styles, identities and tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick #1: Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, &lt;em&gt;Relationship Series&lt;/em&gt;, 2008-2013. [Pictured above]&lt;/strong&gt; This beautiful series documents two transgendered individuals in a relationship while transitioning (in opposite directions) from one sex to another. The salon-hung pictures are visually captivating and offer an alluringly intimate portrayal into the lives of these lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick #2: Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, &lt;em&gt;Leviathan&lt;/em&gt;, 2012&lt;/strong&gt; This very visceral work documents the North American fishing industry in 87-minutes of mesmerizing footage. I found myself sitting on the floor of this mini-theater for a good 20 minutes before I could pull myself away from the screen. I would love to watch the film in its entirety in another setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick #3: Bjarne Melgaard, &lt;em&gt;Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby&lt;/em&gt;, 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It’s a room-sized installation complete with Skrillex pillows, half-naked mannequins, and an over-stimulating series of video and sound projections. I think that this room perfectly exemplifies what our lives have become as we become increasingly reliant on technology and the distractions that we coexist with as a product of our artificially created symbiotic relationship with inanimate objects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico City and Tulum]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/mexico-city/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/mexico-city/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 01:30:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/14047495150_894fc588e9_z.jpg)Museo Soumaya
&lt;/div&gt;As part of my Masters program, we took a 5-day trip to Mexico City to survey the art and architecture scene there. The highlights of the trip included: The Museum Soumaya (amazing building, less than impressive collection/curation inside), Frida’s Casa Azul (I’ve been wanting to make a pilgrimage there for ages), the artist’s collective Casa Maauad, Galeria OMR, Kurimanzutto, attending a Lucha Libra fight, staying at the Camino Real Polanco, climbing the Teotihuacan ruins, visiting artist Pedro Reyes’ studio, visiting the Museo Jumux, visiting the Diego Rivera-Anahuacalli and seeing Casa Luis Barragan.

&lt;/div&gt;The following week, I traveled with 4 others from my program to Tulum–where we relaxed on the beach, swam in a cenote, hiked Tulum ruins and ate the most amazing Mexico food.

&lt;p&gt;David Altmejd’s The &lt;em&gt;Flux and The Puddle&lt;/em&gt;, 2014, uses plexiglas, quartz, polystyrene, expandable foam, epoxy clay, epoxy gel, resin, synthetic hair, clothing, leather shoes, thread, mirror, plaster, acrylic paint, latex paint, metal wire, glass eyes, sequin, ceramic, synthetic flowers, synthetic branches, glue, gold, feathers, steel, coconuts, aqua resin, burlap, lighting system including fluorescent lights, Sharpie ink, and wood to create a Richard Serra-like gallery environment at the Andrea Rosen Gallery. The pictures do not do this installation justice. I had to walk around the perimeter a good four times–revisiting the fake ants, re-reading the messages on banana slices and getting a closer look at the ape arms. The entire time you are also grasping for some narrative or linkage between the parts. Is it about biology or it is some dystopian message the artist is trying to convey? Altmejd simply describes the work as a huge ecosystem where everything is connected. Regardless of what you make of the meaning, it’s both visually and physically captivating. Juices will be on display at Andrea Rosen until March 8, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Everything I've Read in 2013]]></title><description><![CDATA[Okay, so it was a slow year for books, but I was enrolled (full-time) in a graduate program.

&lt;p&gt;This post is slightly outdated, but Richard Serra, 74, has new sculptures on display at both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-serra--october-26-2013&quot;&gt;Gagosian&lt;/a&gt; galleries in Chelsea (the exhibition runs until March 15 at the 555 West 24 Street Gallery and February 8 at the 522 West 21 Street Gallery). &lt;em&gt;Intervals&lt;/em&gt; (2013) (pictured above) is on display at the 555 West 24th Street Gallery. It features 24 weatherproof steel plates. Serra’s work is also featured as a permanent part of the Dia:Beacon collection. He is considered a minimalist artist (sculptor) and is known for his steels works that forcefully manipulate and contour the viewer’s body into a confined space. His background as a steel worker influenced his signature medium choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/11914309074_425dd3733f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Richard Serra, 7 Plates, 6 Angles, 2013, Weatherproof steel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on display at the 555 gallery are &lt;em&gt;7 Plates, 6 Angles&lt;/em&gt; (2013) (pictured above), G&lt;em&gt;rief and Reason (for Walter)&lt;/em&gt;, (2013) (not pictured) for Walter De Maria, a close friend of Serra’s, who died this past July, and &lt;em&gt;Counterweights&lt;/em&gt;, (2013) (not pictured).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space at the 522 gallery is dedicated to a single work made of curved, &lt;em&gt;Inside Out&lt;/em&gt; (2013) (pictured above). The work is maze-like and the large contours of the structure push the viewer into several space pockets while towering into the tall gallery space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart]]></title><description><![CDATA[When visitors come off the elevator that leads up to the industrial loft space on Green Street containing the first part of the exhibition…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/macho-man-tell-it-to-my-heart/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/macho-man-tell-it-to-my-heart/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2013 02:32:33 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 510px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/11658947163_67221137ff.jpg)**Figure 1** Felix Gonzalez-Torres, *Untitled (Last Light)*, string of twenty-four light bulbs, plastic light sockets, extension cord, dimmer switch, 1993; Gift of artist to Julie Ault
&lt;/div&gt;*Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart*: *Collected by Julie Ault* is the touring public display of Ault’s private contemporary collection with the addition of some borrowed related works. It is currently on display at Artists Space in SoHo until February 23, 2014 and is split between their 38 Green Street and 55 Walker Street locations. The entire personal collection of Julie Ault, who considers herself an accidental art collector, embodies the spirit of the Alternative Art movement in New York and has been collected over the span of more than three decades. [\[1\]](#_ftn1) The AIDS crisis of the late 1980s, as well as racial and social issues that were pertinent to the Alternative Art movement, anchor the collection as focal points and appear as prevalent themes. The collection features the works of forty-nine different artists including Andres Serrano, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Corita Kent as well as a few select pieces from feminist poststructuralist postmodern artists such as Cindy Sherman, Louise Lawler and Jenny Holzer. As exhibited, *Macho Man* is comprised of 198 total works, 125 pieces at Green Street and 73 works at 55 Walker Street.
&lt;p&gt;When visitors come off the elevator that leads up to the industrial loft space on Green Street containing the first part of the exhibition, they are immediately thrown into a salon style set up, complete with a cluster of Mac desktop computers to the left, large windows to the right and an inviting maze of artwork due north. Grey text marquees across the top of the white walls with phrases and accompanying dates such as “Ronald Reagan 1984,” “World Wide Web 1990,” “Fall of Saigon 1975” and “Tootsie Pop 1973.” The text comprises Felix Gonzalez-Torres’ &lt;em&gt;Untitled (Portrait of Julie Ault)&lt;/em&gt; (1991) (&lt;em&gt;not pictured).&lt;/em&gt; In 1991, the artist asked Ault for a list of formative dates and events denoted by a word, name, place or phrase from which he planned to make a portrait of her. Gonzalez-Torres selected and ordered the entries non-chronologically. The portrait is not static and meant to be modified by the owner. Ault’s portrait has had four permutations since the original. “Collectively the versions diagram the mutability of identity and the flux of life,” said Ault on the piece.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no labels detailing the works on the walls, instead viewers are given corresponding maps with descriptions of the work. The spread out presentation of works on sparse white walls in the loft space offers a stark contrast to the pictures printed in the accompanying exhibition catalog that capture the pieces as they are displayed or stored in Ault’s homes. In this context, the works are given room to breathe and extracted from their cluttered, lived-in element for public access. Although the works are taken out of their natural habitat, there is still a personal touch and cohesive theme that remains and radiates from the body of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition continues at the Artists Space’s 55 Walker location, where there work is displayed in a central street-level room and the basement. The main room, complete with greenhouse windows, is heavily hung with the works of Corita Kent’s graphic pieces. The basement houses just five works, including a &lt;em&gt;People Magazine&lt;/em&gt; from 1987 honoring Liberace after his death titled “Liberace 1919-1987” and a Danh Vo piece titled &lt;em&gt;Death Sentence&lt;/em&gt; (2010) (&lt;em&gt;not pictured)&lt;/em&gt; that is comprised of sixty-seven hand-written pages of ink on A4 paper with text compiled by Ault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection is notably derived from the body of work and experiences shared in-part by a group of New York-based artists that also influenced the Downtown art scene in the 1980s and 1990s. The cultural climate of this time incubated a specific form of representation that sought to bridge the gap between art and politics.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; Ault’s former membership in Group Material heavily influences the nature of the collection. Ault, who is also an artist, curator, writer and editor, was a founding member of Group Material in 1979. The New York-based artists’ collaborative was responsible for many exhibitions and group projects, notably the &lt;em&gt;AIDS Timeline&lt;/em&gt; (1989), from 1979 until they disbanded in 1996.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; The group’s works assembled various cultural objects through “review, selection and critical juxtaposition” in a collective process that emphasized “shared learning and shared ideas.” This method of working was less concerned with reflecting and more concerned with projecting out into the community. Similarly, Ault’s collection is not strictly archival, but engages in an active inquiry and discourse about cultural climate of this period.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The original thirteen members of Group Material included Ault and Tim Rollins and Felix Gonzalez-Torres in 1987.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; The collection is heavily focused on Gonzalez-Torres’s work and Ault published a Gonzalez-Torres monograph in 2006 after the artist’s death in 1996. Rollins’ work is also featured in the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ault first became acquainted with Gonzalez-Torres in 1987 when she left a note for him at his master’s thesis exhibition in the International Center of Photography’s program at NYU. She told him that she was part of the artist’s collaborative Group Collection and that she wanted to get in touch. Gonzalez-Torres and Ault instantly hit it off and there were many shared perspectives between his work and that of Group Material’s. The two friends visited Paris together in 1992 and that visit influenced some of Gonzalez-Torres’ work.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn7&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; One of his pieces featured in the collection, &lt;em&gt;Untitled (Last Light)&lt;/em&gt; (1993) &lt;em&gt;Figure 1,&lt;/em&gt; takes the form of a string of twenty-four light bulbs, plastic light sockets, an extension cord and a simmer switch. The work was a gift from the artist to Ault in 1993 and &lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt; depicts the work as it is displayed in her Joshua Tree home. Many other items in the collection are pieces by other artists that Gonzalez-Torres gifted to Ault over the years. One such item is Jim Hodges’ &lt;em&gt;A Diary of Flowers: Black &amp;#x26; Blue&lt;/em&gt; (1992) (not pictured), which is a series of seventeen ink-drawn flowers on napkins that are affixed to the wall with pins. The work was installed over Ault’s bed for a couple years, but every time she changed her sheets and spread out the covers, the napkins would get blown around and sometimes a couple would fall and have to be re-pinned. Due to the harmful nature of the exercise of bed-making, Ault decided to store the work in an archival box in the closet.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn8&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;The exhibition’s title *Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart,* is the name of one of the works in the collection with the same title by Steven Evans (1989) *Figure 2*. The work takes the form of vinyl letters and paint on the wall and has been installed over the door to Ault’s bedroom in New York for twenty years. Evans did a disco song title series and gave Ault another work titled *No More Tears,* but she never installed it. Evans also tailored part of his piece *Selections from the Disco* (1989) for Group Material’s *AIDS Timeline* (1989).[\[9\]](#_ftn9) *Selections from the Disco* is also displayed along the bottom of the main room in the 55 Walker space. Printed in pink lettering, the work features song titles such as “It’s Raining Men,” “Do You Wanna Funk?” “Funkytown” and “Never Can Say Goodbye.”
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/11659051674_e890279a58_z.jpg)**Figure 3** Corita Kent, *come alive,* silkscreen, 1967; Collection of Martin Beck; Acquired from the Corita Art Center, by Julie Ault, 1996; Gift of Julie Ault to Martin Beck, 1997
&lt;/div&gt;Ault considers herself an ‘accidental collector’ because the majority of artwork in her collection was given to her as a gifts resulting from numerous personal relationships and conversations with the artists. Some of the pieces in the exhibition that do not belong to Ault, belong to other artists/curators included in the collection and have been gifted to them by Ault. The majority of Ault’s collection pieces are attached to personal anecdotes and a great deal of sentimental value is linked to the art objects. Many of the individual stories of acquisition are detailed in the exhibition catalogue. The one key exception of work that Ault actively acquired is the art of Corita Kent, which piqued Ault’s interest and which she personally sought out.[\[10\]](#_ftn10) Kent was a former nun who decided to leave her life and position at the Immaculate Heart Community in 1968, where she had lived since 1936 from the age of eighteen.[\[11\]](#_ftn11) The exhibition at 55 Walker is heavily focused around Kent’s neon silkscreens that embody the chemical colors and thematic elements of Pop art. Ault published a book about Kent’s work titled *Come Alive! The Spirited Art of Sister Corita.* The piece titled *come alive* (1967) *Figure 3,* was a gift that Ault gave to Martin Beck in 1997. Ault met Beck in Parasite, a short-lived artist group active in New York in the late-1990s and a decade later Ault organized a solo exhibition of Beck’s work. Kent’s work features the words “come alive!” in orange neon on a yellow background and the phrase “you can make it” printed backwards and upside-down in blue lettering. The first Kent piece that Ault acquired was *o is for god* (1968) (*not pictured*) as a gift from her friend Jim Hodges in 1995. After living with the gift, Ault felt compelled to research the artist and discovered that Kent was a Catholic former nun who appropriated product design to make abstract pop art. Ault was interested in the graphic composition, spirited language and complex content contained in Kent’s work. She showed Kent’s work in an exhibition where she juxtaposed her prints from the 1960s with works made by 1980s AIDS activist, artist and designer Donald Moffett.[\[12\]](#_ftn12)
&lt;p&gt;Ault met Andres Serrano in 1980 when he was working at a Chinese restaurant in Queens delivering food and she worked at an answering service as a telephone operator. After the second time that Serrano was robbed at gunpoint for the food he was carrying, he quit his job. Serrano studied art at the Brooklyn Museum School and afterwards got involved in photography, mainly taking documentary style images that he shot on the street. In 1981, he started making photographic images that he saw in his head—often asking Ault to pose in the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 448px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5511/11658947733_c34a072579_z.jpg)**Figure 4** Andres Serrano, *Piss Christ*, cibachrome, silicone, plexiglass, 1987
&lt;/div&gt;In 1989, Serrano became the focal point of a controversy that broke out in Congress and in the media after senators Jesse Helms and Alfonse D’Amato questioned the public cultural funding and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) when Serrano received a fellowship the previous year and exhibited *Piss Christ* (1987) *Figure 4*, which depicts a crucifix submerged in a class of the artist’s urine. A month later, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. cancelled its upcoming Robert Mapplethorpe exhibition, *The Perfect Moment,* which featured the explicit homoerotic pictures of Mapplethorpe’s *X Portfolio.* Mapplethorpe and Serrano were used as examples in the campaign supporting the cessation of governmental funding for “liberal” culture that produced “disastrous effects.” The Culture Wars resulted in the elimination of the category of public funding for individual artists, detrimental cuts in the NEA’s budget and strict limitations on the agency’s support.[\[13\]](#_ftn13) Serrano’s *Black Jesus* (1990) *Figure 5* was produced during the aftermath of the controversy and the artist gave the work to Ault as a gift. Serrano also produced a series of Klu Klux Klan portraits, including *Klansman (Imperial Wizard II) (*1990) *Figure 6,* which was another gift to Ault. For Serrano, upon dealing with the Klanspeople, they became more powerful as symbols than they actually were as human beings. His Klan series was initially exhibitioned along his series of portraits of predominantly African American homeless people.[\[14\]](#_ftn14)
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 290px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/11659051374_6d3c16acf3.jpg)**Figure 5** Andres Serrano, *Klansman (Imperial Wizard II),* cibachome, silicone, plexiglass; Gift of the artist to Julie Ault, 1990
&lt;/div&gt;Since the Ault collection is an ‘accidental collection’ and because of the nature of how the works were acquired, it is a bit obscure and offers a snapshot of a very specific time period and movement as seen through a specific lens within contemporary art. Of her collection, Ault said, “…I do not actively engage in collecting so much as I am committed to formative exchanges and the communities they build. The artworks are cornerstones for exchanges. Dialogue is how I think and work.”[\[15\]](#_ftn15) The collection has a very organic feel and documents both the personal relationships that built the collection and a certain ethos surrounding Ault’s engagement with the Alternative Art movement in New York. The diversity of the collection demonstrates the way that gifting and the exchange of artworks yields intellectual and emotional affinities.[\[16\]](#_ftn16)
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 436px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/11659051354_bd8709fdb1_z.jpg)**Figure 6** Andres Serrano, *Black Jesus*, cibachrome, silicone, plexiglass; Gift of the artist to Julie Ault, 1990
&lt;/div&gt;Ault did not have conscious archiving in mind when she began the collection, but rather she was tracing relationships and work contexts. She lives with the works to experience their extent in her environment and their interconnectedness produces a social commentary.[\[17\]](#_ftn17) Serrano’s Klu Klux Klan and religious-themed pieces, the controversy circling his works, and other socially, patriotically and racially themed works in the collection give it an American pseudodocumentary feel. Danh Vo’s *Chachug Nareekarn* (2011) (*not pictured*) cements this idea, taking the form of a golf leaf on cardboard American flag. It offers a borderline tacky, not entirely accurate portrait of very specific pockets of American culture.
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition also has an accompanying film series curated by Jason Simon with Julie Ault selected and extended from the Ault collection. &lt;em&gt;Macho Man Tell It To My Heart&lt;/em&gt; was on public display at the Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Basel, Switzerland and the Culturgest in Lisbon, Portugal earlier in 2013. A collection catalogue, which was published for the touring exhibition offers pictures of selected works in Ault’s private homes that she shares with Martin Beck in New York City and Joshua Tree, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macho Man&lt;/em&gt; was conceived with the aim of being able to see all of the works together and grasp how they related to each other outside of their domestic context, which was not possible in a small residence.&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn18&quot;&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt; After the collection finishes its tour, it will make its way back onto the walls of Ault’s homes and into the storage boxes in her closets and under beds—where amongst other personal items such as clothing, books and films, pots and pans, it is meant to be lived with. The nature of the collection, much like Gonzalez-Torres’s &lt;em&gt;Untitled (Portrait of Julie Ault)&lt;/em&gt;, is mutable and will continue to grow and change, as it has, echoing the ebbs and flows of Ault’s personal relationships, partnerships, collaborations and conversations. “The collection is not certain,” said Ault. “It extends along the lines of exchanges that are in flux and growing…&lt;em&gt;Tell It To My Heart&lt;/em&gt; activates this buildup of art anew as we investigate how to engage and unfurl ‘the collection’ in the present tense.”&lt;a href=&quot;#_ftn19&quot;&gt;[19]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;The Guggenheim in New York is always a good quick stop to see an exhibition–I’m also glad that I finally have time free time to see art now that my semester is over. Currently the main exhibition is *Christopher Wool,* which is on view until January 22, 2014–but there is also a small Kandinsky exhibit (Kandinsky in Paris 1934-1944) and a Motherwell exhibit (Motherwell: Early Collages) that I really enjoyed.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 426px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3750/11659068196_3c127f77dd_z.jpg)Untitled, 2000
&lt;/div&gt;The above painting is emblematic and the main painterly style that is attributed to Wool. Wool, like many other painters, experimented with text, monochromes, flatness and figureless works to “bring painting to an end.” His works are often graphic. [*The New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/a-christopher-wool-show-at-the-guggenheim.html) cites something problematic with the show–it seems padded–with three series of grainy Wool photographs. The show did feel a little bit repetitive and I found myself rushing down the rotunda to the end. After I saw a few key graphic pieces, I was satisfied with the trip. My favorite pieces were the ones that combined forms of abstraction with graphics in the background such as the following *Untitled* from 2002.

&lt;/div&gt;Back at the beginning of November, our class took a trip to Dia:Beacon. Everyone was assigned an artist to present and I was assigned Fred Sandback–whom I knew nothing about beforehand. Here’s a bit about Sandback’s sculptures:
&lt;p&gt; Fred Sandback’s acrylic yarn sculptures are designed to coexist in the space with the viewer. They outline planes and volumes in space and make the viewer conscious of the space, which he or she is occupying and sharing with the sculptures. Sandback calls this the “&lt;strong&gt;pedestrian space&lt;/strong&gt;” of everyday life. The works embody the concept of &lt;strong&gt;oneness&lt;/strong&gt;—between the space, the viewer and the work. This is something that the viewer experiences when they’re walking through the work and around the work and manipulating their body in the gallery space alongside the work. He’s not after painting’s space or sculpture’s traditional form of space—for the most part. What he’s after is literal, everyday space. The work is described as still sculpture, while less dense, with ambiguity between exterior and interior. He described the works as: &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;drawing that is habitable.&lt;/strong&gt; The term pedestrian also involved the idea of utility—that a sculpture was there to be engaged actively, and it had utopian glimmerings of art and life happily cohabiting. The work engages the viewer using simple lines and vectors anchored to the walls and floor. They’re about the here and now through bodily presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sculptures were made for the Dia space and respond to the architecture of a specific interior. While, they can be replicated in different locations, the situation is completely changed upon the moving of a sculpture. The dimensions and proportions aren’t all that’s important, but the color of the yarn and piece as a whole is constructed in proximity to it’s location and neighboring structures. The yarn is stretched in between points of the interior, and either produces floor-to-ceiling verticals or outlines closed forms. The idea is that the yarn, which has a slightly fuzzy property, loses its physical presence and turns into a dematerialized lines of color. The compositions also have an illusionistic effect where the colored lines appear to form the outline of transparent, glasslike planes. His work is not just about specific objects, but it’s about specific situations. For these “Untitled” works, Sandback integrated old pieces with newer ones to ground the viewer in a specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandback developed a singular body of work that addresses phenomenology or subjective experience and consciousness. His paradoxical play with material fact and perceptual illusion had philosophical implications. His sculptures define the edges of virtual shapes and the viewer’s brain is supposed to perceive the rest of the form—he wanted sculpture without a center. In this sense, he’s the anti-Ricard Serra because instead of forcing you into space, you are invited to move about freely within a space. You aren’t closed in and there’s no challenge in moving around the work—but quite the opposite. You’re free to move about and you always know where you stand with the work—which gives it a transcendent quality. The work is also reminiscent of Duchamp’s “Mile of Yarn” (1942) where the artist entangled a gallery space with 5,280 feet of yarn. The work occupies a post-modernism presentation because the gallery space is no longer neutral. The sculpture is supposed to be part of a continuing attitude and relationship to things—meaning that certain sculptures aren’t always seen as discrete objects, but more as instances of a generalized need to be in some sort of constituting relationship with the environment. Emerging during the heyday of Minimalism, Sandback’s art has separated itself from that of his immediate predecessors by its refusal to be reductively literal and material isn’t its primary mode of being. While the work itself is minimal, it’s conceptually based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My work is full of illusions, but they don’t refer to anything.” -Sandback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sandback grew up with an interest in stringed instruments, which is where his use of material comes into play. He used to make banjos and dulcimers and his first sculptures were made with metal wire and elastic cord—but he eventually dropped the mass and weight of these materials in favor of store-bought acrylic yarn because its matte surface absorbs rather than reflects light and it doesn’t sag. He was attracted to this composition because he was able to manipulate something that was both existing and not existing at the same time. The forming of the figure—the shape and the dimension, had an “ambiguous and transient quality.” Sandback wanted to make sculpture, but he didn’t necessarily make a sculpture without a composition of parts or a sculpture without positive and negative spaces—but he wanted to make sculpture and these things seemed to be getting in the way for him.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started exclusively using yarn around 1971, after in the last 1960s, he was making series of assemblages of industrial material. Sandback grew frustrated with the parts and thought that they didn’t have enough energy or conviction. The first sculpture he made to begin his signature compositions was made from a piece of string and a little wire, in the outline of a rectangular solid 2 x 4 inches lying on the floor. He said that this opened up a lot of possibilities for him because he could now assert a certain place or volume in its fully materiality without occupying and obscuring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandback had a background in philosophy–he had a B.A. in philosophy from Yale and his MFA in sculpture from Yale in 1969. He suffered from depression and committed suicide in his studio at age 59 in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peter Saul at the Mary Boone Gallery]]></title><description><![CDATA[Icebox (1963) **Peter Saul at the Mary Boone Gallery **Paintings from the 60s and 70s (1 November to 21 December 2013) Give someone who is…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/peter-saul-at-the-mary-boone-gallery/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/peter-saul-at-the-mary-boone-gallery/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 00:08:58 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7396/10969874914_d93206baae_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Icebox (1963)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maryboonegallery.com/index.html&quot;&gt;**Peter Saul at the Mary Boone Gallery&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paintings from the 60s and 70s (1 November to 21 December 2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give someone who is under the influence of psychedelics a large canvas, a spectrum of acrylic paint, some Sharpies and no written instructions. If they are not too busy running away from neon jungle predators, the end result may look a lot like a Peter Saul piece. The depiction of familiar childhood cartoons in adult situations and the incorporation of Dayglow colors into interpretations of historical masterpieces map Saul’s works as a hybrid between Pop Art and Surrealism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to discern any deeper meaning or even suggest a linear narrative in most of these bold and playful paintings. However, they still manage to allure—at least initially. Take &lt;em&gt;Icebox&lt;/em&gt; (1963) for example. Mickey Mouse is pushing a large red bowl in the lower left hand corner while a dog stares tête-à-tête into a large green phallus. Meanwhile, an assemblage of cans and food dance out of the icebox proper’s ajar door and a cartoon arm is holding a Statue of Liberty-esque figure with a dollar sign for a face, a green squiggle for a body and bouncy brown locks—among other quirky features. Is this a commentary about mass culture and frivolous spending? Is this a nod to Saturday morning cartoon marathons coupled with a classic case of the munchies? Although the physical evidence is inconclusive, it is a fun exercise to attempt to assemble the proverbial puzzle pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The color schemes are reminiscent of Pop Art, but select pieces, given their subject matter and situational content, radiate an automatist, surrealist feeling that seems to be uncalculated and derived straight from the unconscious. With a knack for “the lurid, the tasteless, the violent, the political – with a heavy gloss of absurdist humor,” according to the press release put out by the Mary Boone gallery, the exhibition occupies the space between amateur figurative painting and 1970s smut magazine cartoons. Dollar signs, bodily fluids, and cigarettes are sprinkled throughout the works, alongside depictions of murder and crucifixion. The overtly political piece, &lt;em&gt;Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; (1966) falls short when it comes to offering an effective commentary with its Dr. Seuss-like caricature portrayal of real world events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3813/10969874774_cf36a3b558_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Nightwatch (1974)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest work in the collection, &lt;em&gt;Nightwatch&lt;/em&gt; (1974), honors the Old Masters, while reinventing Rembrandt’s classic painting with neon hues. In a similar vein, &lt;em&gt;Napoleon Crossing the Alps&lt;/em&gt; (1976-77) shows the noble Frenchman mischievously shooting his surname into the ground with a revolver, while riding a bucking horse. These later, straightforward and more captivating pieces attempt to make up for the comparatively more lowbrow, weaker links in the collection, but the deadweight is too much of a cross to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, the material is interesting in the way that road kill is interesting. It may be fun to look at for a bit, but after the initial glance, there is no need or desire to continue the engagement. There is a lack of focus and the cohesive message is lost, along with the cultural decade during which these works were born.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Venice Biennale Highlights]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/p554/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/p554/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Nov 2013 22:29:11 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Last week I traveled to Venice, Italy for the 55th Biennale with Sotheby’s. Everyone in my program had to present on either an artist or national pavilion and I presented on the Lebanese Pavilion at the Arsenale. The artist chosen to represent Lebanon is Akram Zaatari, 47, an archival artist, historian, film-maker, photographer and curator. The message behind his piece, “Letter to a Refusing Pilot” is simply beautiful. The work is a 35 minute film and video installation. Zaatari, who was born in Sidon, Lebanon and is currently based in Beirut, explores issues pertinent to the post-war Lebanon condition. Lebanon was present in the Venice Biennale for the first time in 2007 and returns this year after being absent in 2009 and 2011.
&lt;p&gt;The story told in “Letter to a Refusing Pilot” is non-linear and uses over 5 decades of the artist’s personal materials. When Zaatari, was 16 years old in 1982, a rumor circulated around his small town in Southern Lebanon, which was then occupied by Israeli forces. The rumor stated that an Israeli fighter pilot had received orders to bomb a target on the outskirts of Saida, but the pilot, knowing that the target was a school, refused to carry out the mission, went against orders, swerved off-course and dropped his bomb into the sea. The rumor maintained that the pilot knew the target was a school because he was a former student there and that his family had lived in the city for generations because he was born into the Saida-Jewish community before it disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit about Lebanon’s geographic makeup and history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south. The Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990) was a complex civil war resulting in over 100,000 fatalities. When Israel established itself in 1948 after World War II, about 100,000 Palestinian refugees were displaced to Lebanon shifting the demographic background in favor of the Muslim population. The government was previously dominated by Maronite Christians since the state was created as a safe haven for them by French colonial powers. During the Cold War, the Christians sided with the West, while the Left-wing and Muslim groups sided with the Soviet aligned Arab countries. Fighting between the Maronite and Palestinian forces began in 1975 abd Left-wing and Muslim Lebanese groups later aligned themselves with the Palestinians. Foreign powers intervened and entered the war and Syria occupied most of Lebanon, while Israel occupied Southern Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the story: Zaatari’s father had been the founder and director of that exact school that was supposed to be bombed for twenty years. The school was eventually bombed by another pilot and severely damaged. Decades later, it was revealed that the pilot was real and was born and raised on a kibbutz (a collective community in Israel, traditionally based on agriculture with a structure loosely based on Communism). The pilot’s name was Hagai Tamir and he had never been to Southern Lebanon like the rumor alleged, but like Zaatari, he studied architecture and could positively identify a school house when he saw one from his aerial view. His choice to disobey orders was a his refusal to bomb the school was a secret known only in tight circles for twenty years, until ten years ago when he finally spoke of the act in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece captures the essence of refusal as a conscious decision and generative act. It doesn’t only express adulation, it’s not simply an ode to the pilot and it’s more complex that a mere thank-you letter. Zaatari is continuing an impossible dialogue that the pilot started with the initial act of refusal. The piece’s title is a nod to Albert Camus’ “Letter to a German Friend,” which enforces Zaatari’s interest in excavated narratives and the distribution of images in times of war. Camus, who was a French writer and proponent of existentialism who wrote during his own struggle against violence in the Paris occupation, said “I should like to be able to love my country, and still love justice.” The importance in the story is that is gives a face to the school he’s about to bomb and a face to the pilot and reverberates the message that even in times of war during heightened nationalism, everyone is still a human being. The conflict between ethics and orders is highlighted as a moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was shot in the neighborhood around the school, which has since been rebuilt and incorporates aerial photographs, photos from Zaatari’s own life and childhood, drawings, computer imaging and some of the artist’s personal effects (including a copy of Le Petit Prince) to tell the narrative from the perspective of a teenage boy . One of the opening scenes was shot with a standard HD camera attached to a drone–something that questions technology during modern warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire installation includes a film reel projector, a single movie theater chair under a spotlight with its back toward the screen and a number of cylindrical stools. The movie chair may be read in one of two possible ways–as a throne for the pilot or as a seat for a viewer–a representative figure who is unaware of the immediate circumstances in war-riddled territories. The visual display and literary representation unpack a critical dialogue in the context of post-war Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zaatari investigates the way television and media sources mediate territorial conflicts/wars and is particularly interested in the logic of religious and national resistance movements and the shifting natures of boarders and the circulation and production of images in the context of today’s geographic division in the Middle East. His videos and photo installations look into technologies of image production and communication and the notions of surveillance. His work has also explored male representations of sexuality. Zaarari is interested in salvaging and preserving the past in challenging the perceived norms of history. He is also interested in the intersection of truth and legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Different subjects, characters and figures that I have dealt with in my work in the past never leave me. They often reappear in my life and find their way to reemerge in other later works. They totally inhabit my imagination and make me realize they turn my work into a theater of limitless possibilities. It’s a theater where strangers from different worlds find themselves on a stage face-to-face.” -Akram Zaatari&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Janet Cardiff: The Forty Part Motet at The Cloisers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The above YouTube clip, or any recording of the piece for that matter, will not do the work justice.

&lt;/div&gt;For the first time, [The Cloisers](http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/visit-the-cloisters), as a part of their 75th Anniversary Celebration, are exhibiting a work of contemporary art. The Forty Part Motet (2001) is a sound sculpture installation by Canadian artist Janet Cardiff. The work consists of forty speakers fixed on stands in a ellipse throughout the Fuentidueña Chapel. The speakers continuously plan an eleven-minute version of the forty-part motet *Spem in alium numquam habui* (translation: “In No Other Is My Hope”) by Tudor composer Thomas Tallis (YouTube like embedded below). Each individual unaccompanied voice and part (bass, baritone, alto, tenor and child soprano) is represented by a single speaker.&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/7Cn7ZW8ts3Y?rel=0&quot; style=&quot; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above YouTube clip, or any recording of the piece for that matter, will not do the work justice. It’s best experienced in the chapel, as the artist had intended. The best way to experience the piece is to walk around the inside of the speakers and take in and pass by every individual voice recording. The waves of sound are overwhelming, awe-inspiring and the room is flooded with the collective voices of this piece as it was intended to be hear. Even in a chorus or live experience, the voices are never so compartmentalized and individualized–they end up blending together. Here, they are isolated and where you stand in the room influences and alters your sensory perception. Part of the experience is also how you, the viewer, manipulate your position in the room and the conscious decisions that you make navigating throughout the piece. The work is a compelling must-see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;This was actually my first time visiting the Cloisters, probably because it’s an all-day affair and takes a while to get there on the A-train, but I throughly enjoyed the visit and the Medieval architecture and marvel. The unicorn tapestries (one piece is embedded above) were another highlight of the visit.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mike Kelley at MoMA PS1]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/mike-kelley-at-moma-ps1/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/mike-kelley-at-moma-ps1/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2013 01:11:14 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 650px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3756/10353540116_12dcb2b7d9_z.jpg)“Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites,” (1991-1999)
&lt;/div&gt;Last Sunday, in between cramming for my Contemporary Post-War Art (1945-Present) midterm, I went to see the opening of the [Mike Kelley](http://mikekelley.com/) retrospective exhibit at MoMA PS1. The exhibit is the first of its kind there and dedicates the entire museum to a single artist, the late Kelly’s work. Kelley, who committed suicide in 2012 by sealing himself inside his bathroom in South Pasadena, California and asphyxiating himself with fumes from a barbecue grill, is often considered one of the most influential artists of the past quarter century and often depicts psychological elements of childhood.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/10353538814_7ec6a213c9_z.jpg)“More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and the Wages of Sin” (1987).
&lt;/div&gt;Kelley most famously used stuffed animals and toys as a metaphor for expressionist art, but also produced an impressive body of other work and worked in a vast array of mediums including drawings, writing, painting, sculpture, performance, video and assemblage. I recently read his essay “Urban Gothic” where he warns against modern architecture and predicts that we’ll all be slaves to machines (which arguably has already happened). His humor is extremely dry and his writing is dense and difficult to work through.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 621px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/10353539886_4da3e53963_z.jpg)“Naked Majas (Bettelheims’ Genital),” (2008-2009)
&lt;/div&gt;Kelley came from a working class background in Detroit and had an MFA from CalArts. For me, knowing an artist’s biography helps me to better understand and appreciate their work. I firmly believe in social art history and I think that it’s impossible to evaluate any work in a vacuum. His work is dark, but it’s also humorous at times–drawing inspiration from and playing on the various the themes of ’70s smut comics, super heroes, philosophy and underground music.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/10353546186_b11a394afc_z.jpg)“City 000” (2010)
&lt;/div&gt;“Day is Done” (2005) is a feature-length “musical” comprised of 32 different video chapters based on extracurricular activities found in a high school year book. This installation focuses on repressed memories and most of the imagery is taken from holiday festivities, hazing rituals and plays. The room that holds this exhibit is eerie, with images of school children and Dracula looming about. While the work speaks for itself, there is an overwhelming and overpowering sense of darkness in the exhibition, overshadowed by the artist’s recent suicide. It’s hard not to consider the psychological state of one who produces such an expansive oeuvre over the course of three decades. The works intentionally stir up the unpleasant side of childhood and manage to make something innocent into something uncomfortable and gloomy.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Deville Cohen: Studio Visit]]></title><description><![CDATA[POISON, Deville Cohen, 2011 from Deville Cohen on Vimeo.

&lt;/div&gt;[Deville Cohen](http://devillecohen.com/), formally trained with an MFA from Bard, was born in Tel Aviv, but is currently based in Brooklyn with a studio in Long Island City. Last week, my “The Work of Art from Studio to Museum” class took my inside the artist’s studio. Cohen takes elements of theater, sculpture, collage and cinematography and works them into assemblages and video pieces (POISON, 2011 is embedded below). He explores how an individual reacts and interacts with their surrounding environment. &lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 56.2%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/32850085?dnt=1&amp;amp;app_id=122963&quot; style=&quot; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POISON, Deville Cohen, 2011 from Deville Cohen on Vimeo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio, overlooking a portion of the Manhattan’s midtown skyline, is part video maze and part ordered creative chaos. The first thing you see when you walk into the meticulously well-organized space is a larger-than-life 2-D rotating Xeroxed cheese grater, that leads to the “video space,” used for the backdrops in his video pieces. Cohen initially works solo on his pieces that marry the animate (human) with the inanimate (cars, zebra skin rugs, Xeroxed copies of moose, ladders, kitchen appliances) while playing with Xeroxed images and scale bending; however, he later employs the help of others in the filming and production, which are shot offsite. If Cohen gets the 3,000 square foot space he is currently vying for in Portland, Oregon, he will have to meet a February 2014 deadline to complete his current work-in-progress, based on the X-Files, ZERO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 490px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3762/10257529315_5244421b6b_z.jpg)The storyboard for ZERO
&lt;/div&gt;The various objects occupying the studio—lava lamps, boxes of binder clips and clothespins, Shakespearean works, power drills, wooden dowels, Gorilla Glue, etc., all give a slight glimpse into the spirited processes involved in creation. It would be interesting to document the evolution of his work since he currently uses architecture printers in Manhattan Staples and Kinkos, does not own a Xerox machine of his own and despite its extremely ephemeral quality, uses paper due to its low cost. The brief, intimate encounter with Cohen and his workspace painted him as a low-tech artist concerned with space (the book *Full Moon* sat on a Rubbermaid table in the middle of the studio), physics, (several equations, i.e. gravity, were part of his ZERO storyboard), geometry and highlighting the relationship that exists between humanity and the physical world.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hopper Drawings at The Whitney]]></title><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/hopper-drawings-at-the-whitney/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/hopper-drawings-at-the-whitney/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2013 02:40:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 504px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3706/10093221503_909f1405dd_z.jpg)Two Hand Studies, c. 1905-06, Charcoal on paper
&lt;/div&gt;My parents came to the city from Connecticut to see the [Hopper Drawing exhibit](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/HopperDrawing) during its last few days at The Whitney. Currently there’s also a [Robert Indian exhibit (Beyond Love)](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/RobertIndiana) running though January 5, 2014 and a [T.J. Wilcox (In the Air) video instillation](http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/TJWilcox) running through February 9, 2014 at the museum. My mother was ***very*** excited about seeing the Hopper exhibit before it closes on Sunday. The collection highlights the drawings and creative process of American realist painter and printmaker, Edward Hopper (1882-1967). Since we’re often viewing the final work products of painters, we tend to forget the work involved that goes into making a finished piece.

&lt;p&gt;Last Friday, I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://philipjohnsonglasshouse.org/&quot;&gt;the Philip Johnson Glass House&lt;/a&gt; with my class at Sotheby’s. Located in New Canaan, CT, the Glass House is an archipelago of art, buildings and installations strategically laid out across the 47-acre historic preservation. The personal collection belonging to the late architect and designer is comprised of sculptures, paintings and personally designed structures drawing inspiration from different centuries of styles—i.e. the windows of the Brick House, which served as a more private bedroom and guesthouse, were taken from the Duomo in Florence, Italy—though the Glass House is hailed as a modern house monument. The majority of works were acquired by the architect himself during his long tenure of design and through the channels of his impressive network of artists and designer acquaintances—though some acquisitions were obtained and curated posthumously. The Glass House proper (which Johnson also shared with his life-partner, David Whitney) sits on the edge of a hill, overlooking a manmade pond and staircase sculpture. Uplighting was installed on the roof to illuminate the surrounding trees at night and the paths connecting the buildings are meticulously calculated, guiding visitors to take in the New England landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7427/10055384735_d66234dc1f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Frank Stella’s work in the art gallery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising works in the collection is the freestanding Nicolas Poussin piece in the ‘living room’ of the Glass House, &lt;em&gt;Burial of Phocion,&lt;/em&gt; 1648-1649, that cries out as an anachronism in the otherwise majorly modern compound. The juxtaposition of this piece with the temporary, contemporary E.V. Day exhibit in &lt;em&gt;Da Monsta,&lt;/em&gt; the building originally intended to serve as the visitor center, draws a stark period contrast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/10055425476_d0a8f9291f_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The furniture (mostly designed by Miles van der Rohe) and the majority of pieces in the collection are permanent. The pieces in the sculpture gallery are also permanent and the works in the art gallery, affixed to manually moving walls, are occasionally rotated, but no new pieces are added. The exhibitions in &lt;em&gt;Da Monsta&lt;/em&gt; and the pieces on the coffee table in the Glass House, (an exhibition titled &lt;em&gt;Night&lt;/em&gt; after the 1947 Alberto Giacometti piece with the same title that left the house for repairs and never returned); however, rotate and pay homage to the original architecture and works of the preserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3812/10055355614_5a35caaf20_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Raft of Medusa” by Frank Stella in the sculpture gallery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection seems to be ‘curated’ with minimalist and Mediterranean themes in mind. The sculpture gallery was modeled with Renaissance/Baroque elements of the staircase, reminiscent of a village in the Greek isles. The repetitive geometric patterns throughout the compound—the pool is circular, as are the shapes in the ceiling of the art gallery, the windows of the Brick House and the Donald Judd sculpture at the bottom of the driveway— and the many Frank Stella pieces belonging to the permanent collection, speak to the minimalist qualities of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/10055425706_2bf8683ec2_z.jpg%20&quot;&gt;Part of E.V. Day’s SNAP! exhibition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the collection itself is an impressive array of works pulled from the hands and minds of renowned artists, there is a somewhat eerie quality to a compound absent of its original owner, aside from an Andy Warhol screen printed tribute of the architect in his art gallery. Johnson’s original intention in donating the Glass House to the National Trust for Historic Preservation was to ensure public access to his estate, thus cementing and immortalizing his legacy and glorifying the self. Since this is the first private collection I have seen, I have no point of comparison, but I would imagine that most collections give off the same peculiar feel—the personal touch and craftsmanship of one brilliant, late man’s life work, purposefully assembled and preserved in order to perpetuate his legendary status and pay tribute to his oeuvre.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Art Thoughtz with Hennessy Youngman]]></title><description><![CDATA[“How to Make An Art,” (embedded above), which was posted back in 2011, is the quintessential Hennessy Youngman piece, offering a comedic…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/art-thoughtz-with-hennessy-youngman/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/art-thoughtz-with-hennessy-youngman/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 18:25:02 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 570px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/9886830636_88c1691174_z.jpg)Jayson Musson aka Hennessy Youngman
&lt;/div&gt;In my “The Work of Art from Studio to Museum” class, I was introduced to the artist [Jayson Musson](http://www.jaysonmusson.com/welcomemat.html) (aka Hennessy Youngman). He’s currently based in Brooklyn, but he’s from the Bronx and he holds a BFA in photography from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and an MFA in painting from the University of Pennsylvania. In his internet videos titled “Art Thoughtz” on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/HennesyYoungman) and [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/hennessyyoungman), he takes on the persona of his alter-ego, Hennessy Youngman, while targeting various art topics and playing the role of an art critic or cultural commentator. His witty monologues poke fun at different movements, notions, pop culture references and artists (there’s one specific piece dedicated to criticizing everyone’s favorite punching bag: [Damien Hirst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y_8DWg5W0w)).

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVFasyCvEOg&quot;&gt;How to Make An Art&lt;/a&gt;,” (embedded above), which was posted back in 2011, is the quintessential Hennessy Youngman piece, offering a comedic introduction/surface scratching work summarizing the age old question of “What is Art?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d describe his&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jaysonmusson.com/Miscellaneous_Things_That_Resemble_Paintings.html&quot;&gt; paintings&lt;/a&gt; as somewhat of a Lichtenstein-Basquiat hybrid, with cartoonish figures, bright colors and witty, sometimes offensive subject matter and captions. His commentary and feedback are refreshing because of his urban perspective and it’s nice to get a viewpoint from someone outside of the traditional, hegemonic art critic circle (at this point in the semester I’m really tired of discussing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Greenberg&quot;&gt;Clement Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Rosenberg&quot;&gt;Harold Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt;–but I also dislike &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism&quot;&gt;abstract expressionism&lt;/a&gt;–which is a different story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Yesterday “[Chagall: Love, War, and Exile](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/arts/design/jewish-museum-focuses-on-chagalls-war-years.html?_r=0)” opened at at [The Jewish Museum](http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/chagall-love-war-exile). The exhibit covers the period that Marc Chagall spent in Paris through the time he spent in exile in New York (the 1930s through 1948). His fantasy, surreal, and evocation of the dream state works (31 paintings, 22 works on paper and selected letters, poem and photos) are inspired by his love for his wife, Bella (as well as her death), the war, and the crucifixion of Jesus, which is used as a metaphor for Jewish suffering and oppression and the horrors of the Holocaust. While in the gallery, I overheard a conversation between two patrons in which one man asked another which piece was his favorite. The second man replied, “That’s like choosing a favorite child, it simply cannot be done.” While I agree that the entire exhibit was awe-inspiring and Chagall is definitely one of my favorite painters, I would have to say that “Solitude” (pictured above) was one of, if not, my favorite works there. It was created during Hitler’s rise to power and a Jewish Eastern European town is depicted in the background, while an angel hoovers over black smoke.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Chagall is known for his use of bright, predominantly primary color, and illustrating the Old Testament. The Times’ review of the exhibition describes it as the “thornier side of an artist known for sentimental paintings of floating couples, flying goats and fiddlers on the roof.” The exhibition will be open until February 2, 2013.

&lt;/div&gt;There’s an Artist Lecture Series that’s a mandatory component of my Contemporary Art program at Sotheby’s. Yesterday evening was the first of five. The fashion designers/artist trio and collaborators that comprise the avant-garde fashion label [threeASFOUR](http://threeasfour.com/index.php/), came to talk about their line and their collaborative works. Gabi Asfour, Angela Donhauser and Adi Gil are from Lebanon, Tajikistan and Israel, respectively. The group has collaborated with Yoko Ono, Matthew Richie, Matthew Barney and Björk, among others. On Sunday, Lady Gaga attended their SS ’14 show for Fashion Week at the Jewish Museum of New York (where threeASFOUR will have an [exhibition of their work](http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/three-as-four) September 15, 2013-February 2, 2014). She was reportedly interested in a collaboration with the label. Adi Gil used designed Kate Spade’s collection in 2007 and still works with Kate and Andy Spade. The group has also exhibited at the world’s only Fashion Biennale in Holland in 2011, where their theme was humanity’s alienation from the universe and a red dress was exhibited (pictured above) in order to represent organ tissue and human suffering.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 433px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2870/9725864359_16238ba9ce_z.jpg)threeASFOUR Designers at NY Fashion Week, SS ’14
&lt;/div&gt;What’s even more impressive that their resume and their long list of collaborations is their impetus for creating art and working in fashion (and the cross that arises from their convergence). “Nobody needs another dress, ” said Donhauser. “The message behind it needs to touch something else.” threeASFOUR uses their fashion line and their art installations to promote peace in the Middle Eastern region and to emphasize the common ties that the combative groups there share. In a video piece they produced titled “Shesh Besh,” (posted below) the ancient board game, with the same name, is used as a unifying “matchmaker” facilitating harmony between Jewish and Arab cultures. The team draws its primary inspiration from geometric shapes and the hypercube (notably, the origin of the Star of David), which is the central focus of many of their patterns. They group also noted that some of their other inspirations include origami and crop circles. The piece (pictured below) from their SS ’14 line is a fractal design that was 3D printed.

&lt;p&gt;The group also noted during a Q&amp;#x26;A session that commercial and compromise don’t have to be synonymous–the label was recently rejected from Target for the production of a lower-end line. Despite reluctance to work with Lady Gaga, they remain open to collaborations for the purposes of gaining exposure–but the trio also assured that they would not “sell out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; style=&quot;width: 434px&quot;&gt;![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3762/9725864311_874ed7eb7e_z.jpg)threeASFOUR SS ’14 3D printed fractal design
&lt;/div&gt;“It’s not enough to be an artist–you must also be a business man in fashion,” offered Asfour.
&lt;p&gt;“Life is our school,” said Donhauser after she was asked about their formal education and noted that both she and Gil dropped out of a fashion program in Germany. “You have to be a curious person, the rest is always history.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sotheby's Institute of Art]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andy Warhol Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, 1985 After an impromptu, last minute decision to apply to Sotheby’s Institute of Art’s…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/sothebys-institute-of-art/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/sothebys-institute-of-art/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 00:46:10 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/9728892332_ff1b49f501_z.jpg&quot;&gt;Andy Warhol &lt;em&gt;Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom,&lt;/em&gt; 1985&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an impromptu, last minute decision to apply to Sotheby’s Institute of Art’s Master’s program in Contemporary Art (and more importantly receiving admission), I am currently pursing my Master’s degree in art history. I was originally slated to go to NYU’s Institute of Fine Arts to study Italian Renaissance Art, but I decided to switch gears and go a slightly different route at Sotheby’s. While I still love the realism and religious subject matter of Italian Renaissance Art and it will always hold a special place in my heart because I studied abroad in Florence back in 2008, professionally and in terms of practicality this move is the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit about SIA: the New York branch just opened in 2006, so the program is still in its infancy. The specific program I’m in focuses on Post-War art (1945-present) and walks students through theoretical and analytical methods to approaching art. Students have the option of completing a third semester in London or New York or they can opt to write a thesis during the summer/early fall following their second semester. This semester my classes include: Contemporary Art: 1945-Present, Theories of Post-War Art, Research Methodologies: Writing about Contemporary Art and The Work of Art, from Studio to Museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I’m excited for this program: 1) It means that I’m back in school and I’ve really missed the world of academia–this is where I thrive. 2) The curriculum incorporates a travel component–this semester we’re going to visit the Venice Biennale and in the spring we’re going to Dubai. 3) I get to study art history in the artistic epicenter of the international art world. There are also site visits to local galleries, museums, and exhibitions. There are periodic artist lectures and there’s a vast alum network. Classes started this Monday and we’re already in full swing. It’s wonderful to be an art student and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andy Golub: Body Painting in Times Square (NSFW)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andy Golub’s body painted models in Times Square Yesterday, while walking to meet a friend to see a Broadway show (tangent: we lost the…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/andy-golub-body-painting-in-times-square-nsfw/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/andy-golub-body-painting-in-times-square-nsfw/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2013 23:27:31 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, while walking to meet a friend to see a Broadway show (tangent: we lost the lottery for Wicked tickets, but instead got student tickets to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romeoandjulietbroadway.com/&quot;&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/a&gt;, now starring Orlando Bloom), I ran into body painter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andygolub.com/&quot;&gt;Andy Golub&lt;/a&gt; and about a dozen of his models. The models, along with Golub’s custom painted car, were part of a photo shoot and swarms of tourists/amateur photographers crowded around to snap some raunchy shots. Golub’s subjects ranged from young to elderly and slender to pudgy. Since there were so many people crowding around the front sides of the models, I was only able to capture the gang from the back (this may have been for the best).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9616003111_ff2929f592_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist held another “show” in Times Square &lt;a href=&quot;http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/naked_models_take_over_times_square.php#photo-1&quot;&gt;back in July&lt;/a&gt;, with only two models. One of his models was arrested in 2011 for public nudity and Golub has been arrested for charges of public lewdness. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://naturistaction.org/StatesFrames/State_Laws_Frames/New_York_Laws/body_new_york_laws.html&quot;&gt;New York penal code,&lt;/a&gt; while public lewdness (“when someone intentionally exposes the private or intimate parts of his body in a lewd manner or commits any other lewd act (a) in a public place, or (b) in private premises under circumstances in which he may readily be observed from either a public place or from other private premises, and with intent that he be so observed”) is a class B misdemeanor, the “exposure of a person is “permitted in the event of breastfeeding of infants OR if any person is entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment.” Fun fact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[5 Pointz, Long Island City]]></title><description><![CDATA[5 Pointz, Long Island City One of the really great parts about living in Long Island City is the close proximity to contemporary art…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/5-pointz-long-island-city/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/5-pointz-long-island-city/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 23:35:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the really great parts about living in Long Island City is the close proximity to contemporary art galleries and venues. In addition to the waterfront views, an abundance of authentic ethnic restaurants, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nysparks.com/parks/149/&quot;&gt;Gantry Plaza State Park&lt;/a&gt;, LIC houses a small, but concentrated offering of art, perhaps only second to Manhattan. The list includes: MoMA PS1, 5 Pointz, Socrates Sculpture Garden, the Museum of the Moving Image, the Noguchi Museum, and several other, smaller galleries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3833/9542794212_f3a37e40ef_z.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://5ptz.com/&quot;&gt;5 Pointz Aerosol Center, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; is an outdoor graffiti exhibit, sprawled out on the walls of a 200,000 sq. foot factory building. Aerosol artists come from around the world to paint pieces on this industrial space. The name derives its concept from the five boroughs coming together as one at this “epicenter” of the graffiti scene. Since its founding in 2002, the almost empty factory warehouse has attracted a number of hip-hop and R&amp;#x26;B stars to the site. Filmmakers, photographers, and tourists flock to the site to complex to bask in the colorful aerosol glow of over 350 murals. The building is perhaps best seen from the 7-Train between the Queens Plaza and Hunter’s Point stops. Rooftop access is available to those who partake in a paid tour of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gallery’s curator is Jonathan Cohen, a graffiti veteran also known by the tag “Meres One.” His objective is to convert the five-story, block long complex at Jackson Avenue and Davis Street into a graffiti art museum. Unfortunately, the City Council has been working to tear the over-100-year-old industrial complex down, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/queens-borough-president-backs-luxury-towers-5pointz-article-1.1401185&quot;&gt;“by the end of the year, if all goes as planned.”&lt;/a&gt; One of the only remaining factories in the otherwise vacant complex is a seamstress shop on the ground floor, just off Crane Street. There has been speculation for a while that the complex would be torn down to make way for a fleet of luxury, residential towers.&lt;/p&gt;

My roommate, Joey, just returned (bronzed, chipper and wanderlustful) from a three week trip to Sicily. We both have family and roots in Messina, a coastal city in Sicily. He primarily stayed with family in San Vieto, but also visited Messina, Giuloana, Taramena, Palermo, Cefalu and Troina. I’ve posted a slideshow of some of his [Instagram](http://instagram.com/josephcricchio) pictures from the trip. He brought me back a ceramic [triskelion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion), which is the ancient symbol of Sicily.</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marina Abramović: The Artist is Present]]></title><description><![CDATA[Serbian performance artist, Marina Abramović, 66, has been active in her career since the 1970s.

&lt;/div&gt;**“Performance \[has\] never been a regular form of art, it’s been \[an\] alternative \[form\] since I was born. I want it really to be a real form of art in a respect, before I die.”**
&lt;p&gt;Serbian performance artist, Marina Abramović, 66, has been active in her career since the 1970s. Her works are direct, bold and sometimes violent. She tests the limits of the human body, often employing fasting, silence and inaction for prolonged periods of time. She challenges the audience because of the level of discomfort that may accompany viewership. Performance art uses time, space and sometimes other mediums to facilitate a relationship between the viewer and the performer. I had the opportunity to view the artist’s work during undergrad in New York back in 2010, when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/965&quot;&gt;The Artist is Present&lt;/a&gt; was being exhibited at the MoMA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From March 9-May 31, 2010, during MoMA’s regular hours, Marina was actually present in the museum. For seven and a half hours, six days a week, Marina sat motionless in a wooden chair in front of a table, while viewers rotated to the seat opposite her for a rare chance to be part of the exhibition and to get to bask in the artist’s energy. New York Magazine published an&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/66163/&quot;&gt; illustration &lt;/a&gt;speculating how the artist peed during her performance (theories included: bedpan, diaper and catheter). The conclusion, released in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vulture.com/2010/06/marina_abramovic_never_pees.html&quot;&gt;followup article&lt;/a&gt; said that she holds it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A documentary (that shares the same name as the 2010 MoMA exhibition), Martina Abramović: The Artist is Present (2012) details Abramović’s life as an artist and explores the preparation required for the exhibition. She explains to a group of protégés who go on a training retreat in her house located in the Hudson Valley, that the most important aspect of being an artist, regardless of what kind of work you’re doing, is the state of mind in which you complete the work. The documentary also exposes a troubled side of Abromović as she recounts a loveless relationship with her mother who never kissed her “not to spoil” her and discusses how her mother would whip her in the middle of the night if her bed was not straight because she was “sleeping too messy.” The artist is largely influenced by Communist discipline and spirituality instilled from her grandmother’s upbringing (since her parents had political careers they did not have time for her).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the artist/viewer relationship, in Rhythm 0 (1974), Abramović allowed the audience to use a table of 72 objects in any way that they chose against her while she played a passive role. Objects included a rose, a gun, a single bullet and a pair of scissors. Initially audience members were tame and did not inflict bodily harm, but as the six hour show progressed, the audience began to act more aggressively and poked her with thrones, drew blood and even pointed the gun at her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Rhythm 5 (1974), she leapt into a burning pentacle (after cutting her nails and hair and tossing them into the flames) and unbeknownst to viewers actually lost consciousness for a period of time due to the last of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artist also has a series of works with West German artist and friend/former lover Uwe Laysiepen (Ulay). The pair traveled, performed and lived together throughout Europe in a van. The couple separated, but remain friends. In Abramović’s manifesto she states that an artist should never love another artist. She also mentions that an artist should not steal another artist’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat controversially on July 11, 2013, rapper Jay-Z performed his song “Picasso Baby” for &lt;a href=&quot;http://pitchfork.com/news/51474-jay-z-performing-picasso-baby-for-six-straight-hours-today-apparently/&quot;&gt;six straight hours&lt;/a&gt; at New York City’s Pace Gallery. During the performance, Abramović gets onto the platform where he’s performing and gives him an emotionless glance, almost as if she’s saying “Yes, you are stealing what is mine, but I will lend it to you for now.” Jay-Z has recently come out and called himself a performance artist. You can have partial (okay, minuscule) ownership of the Nets, a clothing line, Beyonce, a record label, dinners with the Obamas, speculation of ties to the illuminati, a sports agency, a past dealing “rocks” on the streets of Brooklyn, but leave the performance art to Marina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[James Turrell: Aten Reign at the Guggenheim]]></title><description><![CDATA[Other earlier Turrell works (from the ’60s and ’70s) are also on view and use a LED, projected and Tungsten lights to create light…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/james-turrell-aten-reign-at-the-guggenheim/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/james-turrell-aten-reign-at-the-guggenheim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2013 17:06:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_286&quot; style=&quot;width: 235px&quot;&gt;[![&quot;Aten Reign,&quot; James Turrell at the Guggenheim](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_3717-225x300.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_3717.jpg)“Aten Reign,” James Turrell at the Guggenheim
&lt;/div&gt;I know I’m really late here, but I (finally) saw the James Turrell exhibit at the Guggenheim yesterday (after venturing through the Park Avenue Tunnel, going to a used record sale at Lincoln Center, and watching street performers dance in Center Park). The exhibition examines perception, light, color and space, while emphasizing the site specificity. Different colored artificial and natural light dance over the curves and openness of Frank Llyod Wright’s architecture, allowing museum patrons to see the space as they never have before.&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Reminiscent of the [Ann Hamilton exhibit at the Armory](http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/ann_hamilton/) last winter, the viewer is given the opportunity to lie beneath the installation on mats and experience it on their back. The coveted spots on the circular mat at the bottom of the Guggenheim’s rotunda are surrounded by eager museum-goers looking to rest their heads and engulf themselves in the lights and colors of “Aten Reign” (2013). While “Aten Reign” is viewable from everywhere on ground level of the rotunda, lying down on your back and getting lost in the rings of color is really the best way to experience the show.
&lt;p&gt;Other earlier Turrell works (from the ’60s and ’70s) are also on view and use a LED, projected and Tungsten lights to create light projections on flat walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turrell, 70, is from LA and his works focus on light and space. He has a permanent exhibit built into MoMA’s PS1 entitled “&lt;a href=&quot;http://momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/170&quot;&gt;Meeting&lt;/a&gt;,” (1986). “Meeting” is a square room with white walls and wooden benches around the perimeter with a rectangular opening cut into the ceiling for sky viewing. Currently he is working on the ongoing project &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodencrater.com/&quot;&gt;Roden Crater&lt;/a&gt;, (1979-) which is a crater near Flagstaff, Arizona that he is currently turning into a naked-eye observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Aten Reign” runs through September 25, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's Voice Tunnel]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Park Avenue Tunnel  For three consecutive Saturdays (August 3, 10 & 17), the Park Avenue Tunnel, with an entrance on 33rd Street and…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/rafael-lozano-hemmers-voice-tunnel/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/rafael-lozano-hemmers-voice-tunnel/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2013 16:09:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49620401441_bc8e032a08_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Park Avenue Tunnel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three consecutive Saturdays (August 3, 10 &amp;#x26; 17), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/nyregion/rare-chance-to-stroll-a-park-avenue-tunnel-in-the-name-of-interactive-art.html?_r=0&quot;&gt;Park Avenue Tunnel&lt;/a&gt;, with an entrance on 33rd Street and Park Ave., is open to pedestrians from 7:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. for an interactive light and sound art show. The electronic artist, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/&quot;&gt;Rafael Lozano-Hemmer&lt;/a&gt;, 45, is from Mexico City and develops interactive installations that are a convergence of architecture and performance art. He cites his inspirations as “phantasmagoria, carnival and animatronics” and his light and shadow works are, according to him, “antimonuments for alien agency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The queue started at 33rd Street and Park Ave. and wrapped around for more than 5 city blocks. They closed the line a little bit after 11:00 a.m. (when the line reached a point with an anticipated wait-time of an hour), but my friends (Kay-Lin and Juan) and I stood in line for about 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibit is an interactive art installation featuring 300 spotlights and 150 loudspeakers controlled by the voices of the public. As you walk through, you hear the messages of hundreds of Voice Tunnel participants. The volume of their voice actually controls the intensity of the lights. If you would like to partake, there is (another) queue to speak into the intercom in the center of the tunnel. Each new voice recorded pushes the previous recording one position toward the end of the tunnel. The result is an intense cascading cacophony of sound and accompanying illumination. The experience can be a bit overwhelming at times, and you are required to sign a waiver before entering (of course I didn’t fully read it, but it was something about seizures and death, sensitivity to light and sound, etc., etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fleeting quality of not only the traveling messages, but also the short duration of this exhibit reminds the viewer about the importance of appreciating the present. “What makes the experience valuable is the fact that it’s ephemeral,” Lozano-Hemmer told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/em&gt; The project “allows us to remember that we are on earth for a very brief period of time, and then we’re going to die. And it helps us live perhaps more intensely. We’re more alert to the fact that it ends, that we’re getting recycled, that there is a flow.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sidecars, Il Bronzino and Reframing Harassment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Allegory of the Triumph of Venus In an attempt to put myself though through grad school, (because I, unfortunately, do not have a trust fund…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/sidecars-and-il-bronzino/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/sidecars-and-il-bronzino/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2013 23:43:58 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Angelo_Bronzino_-_Venus%2C_Cupid%2C_Folly_and_Time_-_National_Gallery%2C_London.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegory of the Triumph of Venus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to put myself though through grad school, (because I, unfortunately, do not have a trust fund), I took a job as a cocktail waitress (after I left my previous position as a paralegal at a large corporate firm) at a bar/restaurant where my roommate, Joey, is a bartender. I’ve worked in the restaurant industry before, but never in New York City. At about 11 p.m. Monday night during my first shift there (the exact time that our dinner menu ends and our late night menu begins), a gentleman comes in and sits down in my section. I had one other table finishing their drinks and while I was a bit eager to go home, I was already there finishing up my shift. Right off the bat, this guy is a character–loud and talkative. He orders bottled water (&lt;em&gt;instructions: a bottle that’s not too big or too small&lt;/em&gt;) without carbonation (&lt;em&gt;because recent studies show that carbonation leads to stomach cancer and drinking hot liquids leads to esophageal cancer&lt;/em&gt;). He tells me that the only women he’s met before that looked like me were from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. When I told him I was Chinese and Italian he responded with “Spicy.” He proceeds to order a sidecar (&lt;em&gt;not too sweet, really cold, with ice chips still floating in it)&lt;/em&gt;. When he’s ready to order, he asks me if I want to dance. Too tired to really entertain him, I replied: Not until my shift is over. He then says, well I’m going to make you dance and orders our organic chicken dish (but substitutes the sweet potato hash for the potato gratin) and then proceeds to return the sidecar (because it was “the worst sidecar he ever had in his life,”) for a glass of the cab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/1901/30368325827_45f5b7a5a8_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madonna col Bambino e San Giovannino&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I promise there’s a point to this story&lt;/strong&gt;. The subsequent interaction goes as follows: he asks me what I’m doing with my life (I give him the art history spiel and tell him I was a sociology major). He tells me I need to read Randall Collins and all about Conflict Theory, he tells me that Bronzino was THE best Renaissance painter there was and he tells me that I need to read Peter Schjeldahl’s art critiques because they are sometimes “better than the art they are reviewing.” He said he was in “astrology” and asked me if I recently had a birthday (I did). Strange way to end the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that this will be the first in a series of somewhat questionable encounters that are the inevitable result of working in the restaurant industry. The experience wasn’t particularly bothersome and perhaps true to nature of giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, it was a harmless exchange between someone seeking conversation after a long day of work and someone who serves food and alcohol (although I didn’t particularly appreciate the spicy comment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a pleasure lecturing you…what’s your name?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danielle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danielle, it was a pleasure lecturing you, Danielle. You said this was your first night?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I’d say you’re in the bonus round.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bit about Il Bronzino:&lt;/strong&gt; Agnolo di Cosimo (1503-1572) usually know as Il Bronzino or Agnolo Bronzino. He was an Italian Mannerist painter from Florence and it is likely that his name refers to his relatively dark skin. (Works pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bit about Peter Schjeldahl:&lt;/strong&gt; He’s the head art critic for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and has written for &lt;em&gt;The New York Times, ARTNews,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Village Voice.&lt;/em&gt; He’s also written several books of poetry and has taught at Harvard in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bit about Randall Collins and conflict theory:&lt;/strong&gt; Randall Collins is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and is a leading contemporary theorist with the following areas of expertise: marco-historical sociology of political and economic change; micro-sociology (face-to-face interaction); and the sociology of intellectuals and social conflict. He is considered to be one of the leading non-Marxist conflict theorists in the United States. Conflict theory emphasizes the role of coercion and power in producing social order.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dubrovnik, Croatia]]></title><description><![CDATA[General overview: it’s clean, it’s safe, the landscape is overwhelming, there are good beaches, there’s good public transportation, it’s a…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/dubrovnik-croatia/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/dubrovnik-croatia/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2013 18:44:52 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_247&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px&quot;&gt;[![Dubrovnik, Croatia](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Dubrovnik-copy-300x225.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Dubrovnik-copy.jpg)Dubrovnik, Croatia
&lt;/div&gt;I’m having a bit of difficulty writing about Dubrovnik because there are so many good things to say about it and I want to be able to properly express how wonderful this city is without missing any important details. I have a good general overview of the staple Western European cities (Rome, Paris, Venice, Barcelona, Florence, London, Dublin, Amsterdam) and even though Dubrovnik doesn’t fit into the Western European city category, it may be one of my favorite European cities overall. The only other Eastern European city I’ve visited is Prague, but in my opinion, Dubrovnik blows Prague out of the water. Prague was beautiful, but Dubrovnik is almost like a theme park at times.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General overview:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s clean, it’s safe, the landscape is overwhelming, there are good beaches, there’s good public transportation, it’s a walking city, it’s easy to navigate, it’s a good central hub and easy to take day trips to neighboring counties, the people are friendly, there’s good nightlife, there’s good food, the natives are happy, and I’d definitely visit again. Most of the people we encountered during our stay were making their way up the Croatian coast and I do regret not being able to do that this trip. Dubrovnik is usually the starting point and then people make their way up to Split and Hvar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in by Bosnia post, we arrived in Dubrovnik via a flight from Athens during the night of Sunday, July 14. We were warmly welcomed by our hostel owners at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dubackpackers.com/&quot;&gt;The Dubrovnik Backpacker’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve stayed in my fair share of hostels over the years and this was definitely at the top of the list. The hostel was started by Ivi, who in turn, got his parents and siblings involved in the business. They run the hostel out of their home and cook breakfast for their travelers every morning in their kitchen. Breakfast is a social event and the whole family makes you feel integrated and like one of their own. They do a great job at giving you the opportunity to meet your fellow hostel mates, which is something I very much appreciated. The indoor/outdoor lounge/kitchen/wifi area and the optional the daily trips facilitate meet-ups and conversations with other travelers. Kay-Lin and I met Canadians, Brits and Aussies (in addition to one Kiwi, one Mexican, one Scottish fellow, one Chilean and two Swiss folks). Our room was in a satellite location (the apartment of an elderly neighbor), but we were still given ample opportunities to bond with the others and our bedroom/living arrangement was fantastic (not to mention impeccably clean and we even had own own balcony!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary areas in Dubrovnik is Old City, where we explored the monastery, various churches, the synagogue and you can walk along the city walls. Most of the nightlife (including the absolutely ridiculous, but really awesome Club Revelin, built into the old Fort Revelin, which is adjacent to a strip club) is in Old City. We also took a ferry to the nearby island, Lokrum, which is covered with roaming peacocks. We hung out on a rock beach and went swimming in the Adriatic Sea. We also (accidentally) encountered a nude beach (mostly old dudes). The nude beaches are denoted by the letters “FKK,” which stands for Freikörperkultur and is a German movement whose name translates to Free Body Culture. This was something that we had to learn (twice) the hard way. The first time was on Lokrum and the second time was stumbling upon an FKK section of Cava beach with Matt the Australian from our hostel. Kay-Lin and I also took a cable car to the top of Fort Imperial for amazing views of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_250&quot; style=&quot;width: 235px&quot;&gt;[![Revelin, Dubrovnik](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Revelin-e1375555248554-225x300.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Revelin-e1375555248554.jpg)Revelin, Dubrovnik
&lt;/div&gt;The night after our Montenegro trip, we were pretty beat and were only planning on going into the Old City for a small dinner. We ran into a bunch of people from our hostel on the bus and they joined us for dinner (crepes on the street). Then suddenly, as we were stuffing our faces with Nutella and fruit filled deliciousness, the power to the entire city went out and we found ourselves standing inside the walls of a fortified city in complete darkness. Kay-Lin and I then agree to have one, just one, drink with the group. We banded together to find a bar that was still serving drinks despite the power outage and our night of drinking commenced! After the power came back on, we stopped at a bodega for cigarettes and beer and headed to Revelin. A note about Revelin: it’s free to get into before 12:30 a.m. and if you are in Old City there is absolutely no way that you’ll miss it because a) it’s the only club anyone talks about b) there are girls in booty-shorts (hot pants as Ivi calls them) handing out fliers left and right and c) the rest of the bars are smaller, pubs and Old City is pretty small itself. The club is open until 6:00 a.m., there are dancers on stage, the music is mostly repetitive (house), the crowd is mostly a meat market (typical for European clubs), you can smoke indoors, there are no windows, but it’s a trashy good time. Our group then proceeded to dance like assholes for several hours in an exclusive circle and it was a great night (that was supposed to just be crepes and then only supposed to be one drink). The sun was coming up when we got home.
&lt;p&gt;For our last night in Dubrovnik, we had a family dinner with a bunch of our mates at a local Italian restaurant. Afterwards, some of us headed to Cave Bar (yes, it’s a bar inside of a cave!) near our hostel and then hung out and drank together for a bit. Minus stepping on a sea urchin (and having to hobble through the airport during our travel back to the States), Dubrovnik was so so so amazing and I’d love to go back. I’m pretty bummed that my travels are over (for the time being), but now I have to plan my next trip. I’m thinking South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Perast and Kotor, Montenegro]]></title><description><![CDATA[Perast, Montenegro Unlike Bosnia, Montenegro was on our original itinerary (the very first itinerary that also included Istanbul).

&lt;p&gt;Perast, Montenegro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Bosnia, Montenegro was on our original itinerary (the very first itinerary that also included Istanbul). Our hostel was offering a trip to Montenegro, so instead of trying to figure out how to get there and what to see, etc., we let Ivica (the hostel owner) take the reigns. While it’s nice to schedule and create your own itinerary, sometimes it’s just easier to book a tour and let someone else do the legwork. I am generally opposed to tours, but since the Bosnia tour went really well so we knew that we were in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stop was Perast, where we took a boat to Our Lady of the Rocks Island, one of two sister islands in the Bay of Kotor. The island is artificial and was created by rocks and sinking old and seized ships filled with rocks. The island houses the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rocks. Legend has it that the island was made over the centuries by seamen who kept an ancient oath after stumbling upon the icon of Madonna and Child on the rock in the sea. The other island, The Island of Saint George, houses Saint George Benedictine monastery (from the 12th century) and an old graveyard for the nobility of Perast. This island was not open to visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49620702652_400426602c_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotor, Montenegro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we visited Kotor, a small coastal town. The port of Kotor is surrounded by fortifications built during the Venetian period. The old town of Kotor is the main attracted for the influx of tourists that have recently been drawn to the area (most via cruise ship). While the surrounding landscape is beautiful, there isn’t much to see within the fortifications, aside from a few churches. The contents and size of Dubrovnik’s Old City also dwarfs Kotor in comparison. After exploring Kotor for a bit, we headed back to Dubrovnik and ended our day at a small, secluded beach encased in large rocks and went for a swim while the sun began to set.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]></title><description><![CDATA[After the waterfalls, we had lunch at a place called Udovice, where we had lamb, potatoes, salad, cheese, chocolate cake (not to mention…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2013 21:14:07 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_228&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px&quot;&gt;[![Mostar, Bosnia](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bosnia_2-300x198.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bosnia_2.jpg)Mostar, Bosnia
&lt;/div&gt;Bosnia was not scheduled on our original itinerary, but in the true nature of this sort of travel, slated items are always subject to change. After Santorini, we took a ferry back to Athens and had a flight out of the Athens airport to Dubrovnik. We got to our hostel after 10 p.m., but were greeted with a “slightly alcoholic drink” (it was straight brandy with a dollop of honey) from a kind and friendly elderly couple in their kitchen. *(More on the hostel and Dubrovnik to come)*. Alcohol was consumed, a slideshow was presented and before we knew it, we were signed up for a trip to Bosnia with our hostel and scheduled to leave at 9:00 a.m. the next morning! Man, what a convincing sales pitch. Bret the Canadian also came in mid-presentation to sign up for the trip and said that it would be a great way for everyone in the hostel to get to know each other. We couldn’t turn down Bret the Canadian!
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_229&quot; style=&quot;width: 310px&quot;&gt;[![Kravica, Bosnia](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bosnia_3-300x198.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bosnia_3.jpg)Kravica, Bosnia
&lt;/div&gt;After a brief night of exploring in Old City, Dubrovnik, which landed us at an Irish pub with some (more) Canadians we met on our flight, we called in a night to get up for our bus in the morning. Eighteen people from our hostel + the hostel owner (the son of the family whose kitchen we found ourselves in) came along for the Bosnia trip. The first stop was at a local fruit stand along the way to sample, well, local fruits! Nothing out of the ordinary, peaches and plums and grapes (all amazing fresh and delicious). The next stop was the town of Kravica, Bosnia to swim in waterfalls. This place was-a pretty well kept secret and with the exception of our group and some locals, it was not crowded at all. The area was littered with dragonflies and the water was freezing, but well worth the dip to gain access to the groves behind the waterfalls.
&lt;p&gt;After the waterfalls, we had lunch at a place called Udovice, where we had lamb, potatoes, salad, cheese, chocolate cake (not to mention amazing wine and brandy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stop was Mostar (pictured at the top of the post), a Muslim town, to see jumpers jump off of the Stari Most (Old Bridge), which is a reconstruction of a 16th-century Ottoman bridge that crosses the Neretva river. In the “jumper’s club,” we had coffee and Turkish delight, while we paged through the signatures of the jumpers. While walking back to the bus, I got into a conversation with a perfume salesman sitting at a table under an umbrella on the side of the road (who thought I was Mexican). “You are from New York?! I do not believe it. Why do you come to Bosnia? There’s nothing here!” Au contraire, perfume salesman, au contraire.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santorini: Red, White & Black Beaches, Blue-Domed Churches and Stray Animals]]></title><description><![CDATA[Oia at Dusk Santorini, the remnant of a volcanic caldera, is the most-visited Greek island and serves as a popular wedding and honeymoon…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/santorini-land-of-beautiful-beaches-blue-domed-churches-and-stray-animals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/santorini-land-of-beautiful-beaches-blue-domed-churches-and-stray-animals/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 02:53:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/7422/9387556591_7bef6078c7_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oia at Dusk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santorini, the remnant of a volcanic caldera, is the most-visited Greek island and serves as a popular wedding and honeymoon destination (which may be why when we checked into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.petranerahotel.gr/&quot;&gt;The Petra Nera Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, the desk attendant asked Kay-Lin and I if we wanted one bed or two). The images you have probably seen of the picturesque blue-domed, white-housed Santorini (located in Oia) do not do justice to the overwhelming beauty that the island offers. We divided most of our time between the following three parts of the island: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oia,_Greece&quot;&gt;Oia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fira&quot;&gt;Fira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Perissa&quot;&gt;Perissa&lt;/a&gt; (other popular tourist destinations include Kamari beach, which neighbors Perissa; Perivolos beach; and Akrotiri, famous for the ruins of the ancient Minoan). Oia &lt;em&gt;(pronounced “EE-ah” and not “OY-ah”)&lt;/em&gt; in known for its white-painted houses built into niches (traditionally used by the crews of ships) on the lip of a volcanic crater. Blue-roofed churches with cupolas are common and the houses are built directly above one another. Fira (or “Thíra”, the ancient name of the island itself) is built upon the edge of the caldera on the western portion of the semi-circular island. Fira serves as the main transportation hub and buses (the only form of public transportation on the island) filter through here. The main nightlife is in Fira and the windy cobblestone streets are filled with small shops and restaurants. Then there is Perissa, (where our hotel was located) which is on the opposite end of the island from Oia and is a small beach town with black sand beaches. Shuttling back and forth between the different areas proved rather difficult (a common thing to do is rent a scooter or an ATV to get around) because the buses are wildly unreliable and the attendants (who collect your money on the bus) can be a bit rude. Taxis are also an option and I believe that there is usually a flat rate of €18 to get from one area of the island to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/5332/9390333322_d6a71929cc_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A church in Oia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49619830963_e50b6aa408_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another church in Oia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay-Lin and I arrived via ferry from Athens at the Athinios port. Our first day, we headed straight for the black-sanded beach in Perissa where we had lunch (octopus salad) and took naps on lounge chairs. At night we attempted to go out in Fira. We took the bus from Perissa and I had the pleasure of sitting next to a middle-aged Santorinian artist who showed us samples of his wooden fruit and vegetables, smelled like he hadn’t showered in five days (five hot summer days), told us about how he met Lady Gaga, proceeded to namedrop and made me look at the tag of his t-shirt (it was Versace) and told me that it was worth €10,000. “&lt;em&gt;Famous people come to Santorini all the time!&lt;/em&gt;” He asked us when we were leaving, asked where we were staying and told us he wanted to see us again before we departed. He also tried to get us to meet him at a bar and when we thought he wasn’t going to leave us alone we ran into a crowded Fira street immediately upon exiting the bus as he was still struggling to get his pieces off of the vehicle. After we ditched the artist, we had crepes and gelato as we scoped out the scene. We tried a place called Town Bar (at the recommendation of one of the waiters from lunch), but it was pretty trashy (think of the European version of American spring-break kids, &lt;em&gt;read: Eurotrash&lt;/em&gt;) and the bars seemed to either be filled with teenagers freshly passing through the puberty threshold or older men. The club promoters were also very aggressive and everyone is offering happy hours and free shots to lure unsuspecting tourists into their (creepy) virtually empty clubs. We (again, just as we had been in Athens) were bombarded with Asian greetings. Needless to say, this experience was enough to deter us from exploring any more nightlife in Santorini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49620615382_59aa84120c_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church built into a cliff in Perissa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we took a bus to Ancient Thira and hiked to the top of the ruins. (It was a €2 entrance fee). Ancient Thira was inhabited from the 9th century BC until 726 AD. The site ruins include private houses, a theater, the agora (market/meeting place), a temple and the Basilike Stoa, which marked the center of public life. After hiking up (and first driving halfway up), we hiked down the opposite side of the mountain toward Perissa and took a detour to climb to a church built into the cliffs (pictured above) at the tip of a friendly British man we rode the bus with earlier that morning. The climb was steep and it felt, at times, like we were not supposed to be there. There were wires and a waterline running into the church, but no sign of any inhabitants or visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/2838/9387572733_b5e5b6cb17_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Beach, Santorini&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we climbed down to Perissa, we took a bus to Akrotiri and hiked (more hiking!) about 15 minutes to the Red Beach (pictured above). This hike is also pretty steep, the path is covered in rocks, and is not for those in poor health. There’s no sand on the beach (just small rocks) and it’s pretty crowded since it’s so small. There are umbrellas and chairs for rent (and there’s hardly any room to put a towel down). It’s worth a visit for the views, but there are definitely better beaches on the island (the black beach in Perissa was better for swimming and sunbathing). That night we had dinner in Perissa (overlooking the beach) at a place called Apollon Tavern. We (accidentally) ordered three entrees (grilled calamari, gyro and souvaki) and I was informed that I have been mispronouncing gyro my entire life and it is actually pronounced (&lt;em&gt;geer-oh&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small side note: There are so many stray cats and dogs everywhere in Santorini, but they seem to be pretty well taken care of by the local community. Most of the animals had collars (some denoting that they were strays) and the locals give them a daily offering of food and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3676/9390341028_ca43943fdc_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View from the hike from Fira to Oia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last full day in Santorini, we completed the hike from Fira to Oia. It’s a 9-10 km (roughly 5-6 mile) journey and took us about 4 hours (but we were walking at a very leisurely pace and stopped frequently for pictures). The hike is very challenging at times and there are a few points there the trail ends and it’s a bit unclear where to continue, but it was one of the best (if not THE best) thing we did in Santorini. The views along the caldera are not easily described using words and the hike should be on every traveler’s bucket list. At the end of the hike, we claimed a spot in Oia to watch the sunset over the town. Oia at sunset is insanely crowded, but it’s worth putting up with the congestion to see the amazing views and the white-houses and churches illuminated by the orange hue of the setting sun.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ancient Athens: Graffiti, Ruins and Fun at the Meat Market]]></title><description><![CDATA[Parthenon, Athenian Acropolis, Greece My travel plans this summer were drastically altered when news of the violent riots in Turkey first…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/athens/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/athens/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2013 17:35:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49619957968_81df817d63_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parthenon, Athenian Acropolis, Greece&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My travel plans this summer were drastically altered when news of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/national_world/2013/07/07/riot-police-break-up-new-protest.html&quot;&gt;violent riots&lt;/a&gt; in Turkey first emerged. I was originally supposed to go to Istanbul and Dubrovnik (with some day trips in between). The Turkish riot police’s tear gas and water cannon use did not sound particularly appealing, so Kay-Lin (my travel companion) and I decided to make some alterations to our itinerary. &lt;em&gt;(Important side note: never use Cheap-O Air, they have the worst, most inaccessible, unaccommodating customer service).&lt;/em&gt; Cheap-O wanted to charge us a $250 fee (apiece) for altering our flight plans in addition to the extra cost of alternate flights. The $55 flight insurance we purchased (under the guise of being able to change our flight without penalty) only covered death, illness and terrorism (not the outbreak of war or political unrest and a particular terrorist act had to have occurred within a one month window from our flight to Istanbul). So after much futile arguing with people in overseas call centers, we kept our flight to Istanbul, cancelled our flight from Istanbul to Dubrovnik and booked a flight to Athens (from Istanbul), a flight to Dubrovnik (from Athens) and a roundtrip ferry from Athens to Santorini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow travelers have warned me about Athens and their common lamentations are mainly that it’s dirty and there is not a lot to see. Taking these warnings into account, but not wanting to pass over the ancient capital city, we booked two nights in Athens and figured that would be enough to cover all of the main sights. After almost a solid 24 hours of traveling (JFK to Zurich, Zurich to Istanbul, and Istanbul to Athens with several hours of layovers in between), we finally arrived at our hostel (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.studenttravellersinn.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Students and Traveller’s Inn&lt;/a&gt;) in the heart of Plaka (Old Athens). I always use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hostelworld.com/&quot;&gt;Hostel World&lt;/a&gt; to book my hostels abroad and it’s a great way to read reviews from patrons and get ratings of important things (like location, cleanliness, security, staff and atmosphere). I try to always stay at hostels with at least 90% ratings (this particular hostel had a 92% rating). Our hostel-mates were two Korean girls who barely spoke English. Needless to say, there was minimal interaction (although one of the girls managed to steal both my and Kay-Lin’s towels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49619957568_dd1696b401_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temple of Zeus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaka is a great neighborhood and it reminded me a lot of Capri, Italy. The cobblestone streets are lined with jewelry, souvenir and gelato shops and restaurants complete with amble outdoor seating. It’s a 10-minute walk to the Acropolis and compared to other parts of Athens, it’s definitely cleaner. The first night of our arrival, we were pretty drained so we just showered and got dinner in Plaka (cold octopus, hummus, olives and tahini sauce) near the hostel. The next morning, since we only had one full day in Athens, we walked all around the city and visited the must-sees. The main attractions we ventured to were the Acropolis (where the Parthenon, the Theater of Dionysos and the Erechtheion can be found), the Temple of Zeus, the Hephaistion, the Ancient Agora (market), and the National Gardens. The Parthenon was a under construction and surrounded by three cranes, so that took away a bit from its enjoyment. I think that the Temple of Zeus was my favorite monument because although it was sparse, it was unadulterated and there was virtually no one else viewing it (as opposed to the Parthenon, which was flooded with tourists). Walking around the sights took the entire morning and a bit of the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we covered the main things we wanted to see, we ventured to the Central Market (where mainly fruit, meat and vegetables are sold). The meat market (complete with skinned lambs, chickens and rabbits with their ears, tails and feet still intact) was a bit overwhelming and the male butchers were intent on shouting various Asian salutations (&lt;em&gt;nǐ hǎo and konichiwa, mostly)&lt;/em&gt; and touching us (I got my arm grabbed, and Kay-Lin suffered a worse fate). I bought a nectarine from an Israeli man (who grimaced when I told him we were American) and Kay-Lin got a free peach from the same vendor (he liked her better for some reason). The men were VERY aggressive. The restaurant workers try (very forcefully) to seat you at their tables and are not afraid to get very much inside the boundaries of your personal space (the concept of personal space does not seem to really exist in Europe). Athens was a good city to see for a couple of days and I feel like we successfully saw everything that we needed to see in the short span of time that we had there (with the exception of the Acropolis Museum, which I was told was pretty cool). I was actually pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my time there considering how much most people told me that it was a bit of a dumpy place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49620741232_3e09053d8e_b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We own the city,” graffiti in Athens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athens in a nutshell: Lots of graffiti, ample ancient ruins, excellent gelato, creepy and overly-aggressive men, tons of stray cats, many headless and limbless statues and Corinthian&lt;/strong&gt; columns for days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Birthdays, Brooklyn and Beer]]></title><description><![CDATA[After the museum, we ventured into Park Slope to Bierkraft, a foodie’s paradise offering an expansive selection of craft beer, artisanal…]]></description><link>https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/birthdays-and-brooklyn-and-beers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsby-starter-blog-demo.netlify.com/birthdays-and-brooklyn-and-beers/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 14:00:14 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_146&quot; style=&quot;width: 235px&quot;&gt;[![IMG_3590](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_35901-225x300.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_35901.jpg)Passing/Posing (Female Prophet Anne, Who Observes the Presentation of Jesus on the Temple, 2003), Kehinde Wiley
&lt;/div&gt;Yesterday was my 25th birthday. I celebrated by dragging my roommate, Joey, to the [Brooklyn Museum](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/) in the slightly rainy and unseasonably cold conditions. While I had visited the [Botanic Gardens](http://www.bbg.org/) (and the museum’s lobby) before, it was my first time viewing the museum’s collection. I was excited for the [Kehinde Wiley](http://www.kehindewiley.com/) pieces, as I had just seen his works that were part of his World State: Israel collection at San Francisco’s Contemporary Jewish Museum. While there weren’t as many Kehinde pieces as I’d hoped for, I was still glad that I got to see his work. I’m a huge Kehinde fan and his large depictions of urban men in heroic stances in front of ornate, often brightly-colored floral backgrounds. His style crosses traditional portraiture with modern iconography, Old Master/Renaissance/French Rococo bourgeois with street scene hip-hop, and offers figurative representations of young black men in positions of power. They’re visually encapsulating and present a commentary on contemporary culture.
&lt;div class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot; id=&quot;attachment_148&quot; style=&quot;width: 235px&quot;&gt;[![Seated Cat, bronze hollow cast, 664-342 B.C.E.](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_3575-copy-225x300.jpg)](http://www.daniellehoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_3575-copy.jpg)Seated Cat, bronze hollow cast, 664-342 B.C.E.
&lt;/div&gt;Another noteworthy exhibit was “Devine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt.” The NYTimes just published [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/arts/design/divine-felines-cats-of-ancient-egypt-at-the-brooklyn-museum.html) yesterday about the collection (currently on view until December 2014). The article discusses the exhibition’s 30 pieces compiled from the museum’s Ancient Egyptian collection, the Egyptian’s fascination with cats, and the link between life on earth and the supernatural thereafter. The Ancient Egyptians did not worship cats per se, but they created their god with cat-like physical features. In the first millennium B.C., cults of feline-goddesses became widespread and increased the demand for votive sculptures for offerings. Priests bred cats specifically for this purpose and examinations of mummies concluded that, at certain temples, kittens were killed (usually by having their necks snapped) and inserted into sculptures which were then sold to pilgrims. Ancient Egypt’s patriarchal society gave way to the belief that goddesses (and women) were unpredictable and dangerous (like cats) and played the dual roles of ruthless killer and nurturing mother.
&lt;p&gt;After the museum, we ventured into Park Slope to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bierkraft.com/&quot;&gt;Bierkraft,&lt;/a&gt; a foodie’s paradise offering an expansive selection of craft beer, artisanal cheeses, gourmet chocolates, and homemade ice cream sandwiches. I sampled the Salted Caramel and Oatmeal Raisin sandwich, while Joey had the Malt Vanilla and Chocolate Chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, I headed to Manhattan to meet my friend Anna in K-Town (at our very favorite bakery, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.touslesjoursusa.com/&quot;&gt;Tous Les Jours&lt;/a&gt;) for some bubble tea and pastries. I ended the night with Annie Hall and a 2012 bottle of Domaine la Voltonnerie Sancerre. All in all, a solid birthday.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Another Trip in the Books]]></title><description><![CDATA[Plaka, Athens It’s always strange for me to come back to New York after a stint abroad.

&lt;p&gt;Plaka, Athens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s always strange for me to come back to New York after a stint abroad. I’m currently in my post-travel city funk. I have this love/hate relationship with this city, and whenever I tell those I meet during my travels where I’m from, I’m met with amazement and a cascade of inquiries and excitement. “What’s it like living in New York?” “I’d love to visit someday.” “You’re so lucky!” Sure, living in New York is great, but when I’m abroad I’m always reminded of what this city could do better. Maybe it’s the true New Yorker in me speaking when I say that because we’re always looking for the next best thing, but my number one lamentation about this city is that it’s difficult (but not impossible) to solidify personal relationships here. Enough about that–back to my travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a goal to visit at least one new country per year. Since 2010, I’ve successfully accomplished this endeavor. Here are my world travels thus far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006:&lt;/strong&gt; Dominican Republic (High school spring break; Cities visited: Puerta Plata).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008:&lt;/strong&gt; Italy (Studied abroad through The University of Connecticut; Cities visited: Florence, Venice, Rome, Sienna, San Gimignano, Pisa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2010:&lt;/strong&gt; The Bahamas, Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2011:&lt;/strong&gt; Ireland (Dublin), France (Paris), Spain (Barcelona and Seville), Italy (Naples, Capri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012:&lt;/strong&gt; England (London), Czech Republic (Prague), The Netherlands (Amsterdam), Brazil (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2013:&lt;/strong&gt; Greece (Athens and Santorini), Croatia (Dubrovnik), Bosnia (Mostar), Montenegro (Kotor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got back from Greece and Croatia, but my eternal compulsion to be a globetrotter can never be quelled. In Greece, I visited Athens and Santorini and in Croatia I stayed in Dubrovnik (with day trips to Bosnia and Montenegro). Each city deserves its own posting and in the upcoming days I will dedicate one post to each city I visited on this trip (and then I will start with back-posts for cities from previous trips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;I had a good friend, Tom, visit me from Melbourne, Australia last week. Tom and I met at the Absolute Paris Hostel back in June of 2011. It was a cramped space, the bathroom smelled like someone continuously pissed all over the walls, but it somehow facilitated and solidified our friendship. We (along with our respective travel-mates) conquered the Louvre and Centre Pompidou together.
&lt;p&gt;Tom had a wedding to go to in Colorado, so he decided to make a trip out of it and visit New York, Mexico and Cuba as well. Since it was Tom’s first time in New York, I felt especially pressured to condense the best of the city’s offerings into his four day time frame. Before he landed in the States, I mapped out an itinerary for him to comb through so he could plan his trip accordingly. Here’s what I came up with (this was taken from an email I sent him):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sights/Main Tourist Attractions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 0.8em;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Statue of Liberty&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm) is actually closed (due to Hurricane Sandy) until July 4, but you can still see it from Battery Park downtown if you have any interest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The National September 11 Memorial &amp;amp; Museum&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.911memorial.org/) (also downtown, close to Battery Park), a tribute to those killed in the September 11, 2001 and February 26, 1993 terrorist attacks. Apparently security is pretty intense there (think TSA airport security).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Times Square&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.timessquarenyc.org/index.aspx) is every New Yorker’s nightmare, but every tourist’s haven (maybe). It’s definitely cool to check out and walk around (albeit, it’s also a bit overwhelming and congested). Take your obligatory photos posing in the glow of the billboards and get the hell out of there before you get accosted by Superman or Cookie Monster asking for you to put tips in a Christmas stocking. The attractions and restaurants here (TGIFridays, Discovery Museum Times Square, The Olive Garden, etc.) are way over-priced and hardly worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Central Park&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.centralparknyc.org/) is a must-see. It starts at 59th Street and extends to 106th Street. Some fun highlights include: Strawberry Fields, The Bethesda Fountain and Terrace, The Hans Christian Andersen Monument, Sheep Meadow (a 15-acre lawn), The Carousel, and The Pond *(“Where do the ducks go in the winter?” -Holden Caufield).*&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Empire State Building&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.esbnyc.com/) is a little pricey and (in my opinion) overrated. You actually get better views from [&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Top of the Rock &lt;/span&gt;](http://www.topoftherocknyc.com/)(but that’s a bit pricey too, it’s $27 to go to the top).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;**Museums:**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;MoMA&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.moma.org/) (The Museum of Modern Art) is pretty awesome. It’s a $25 entrance fee ($14 if you’re a student), but it’s a pretty impressive building and their collection is amazing. There is a really cool exhibit ([the rain room](http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1380)) that is going on right now, (but there might be a line for it).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Museum of Natural History&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.amnh.org/) is great if you’re into, well, natural history. It’s huge and it’s right near Central Park. The permanent exhibitions are pretty spectacular (there are lots of dinosaur fossils and animals).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/span&gt; ](http://www.amnh.org/) is also pretty amazing. It’s HUGE through. There’s a permanent Ancient Egypt exhibition, a Medieval (arms and armor) exhibition, and tons and tons of classic European paintings, modern art. The Met basically has everything from antiquity to Van Gogh to Warhol. I think that if you only have time to see one museum it should definitely be this one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Brooklyn Museum and Botanical Gardens&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.brooklynmuseum.org) You can probabably skip the Botanical Gardens (unless botany is really your thing). I really want to see the Kehinde Wiley pieces at the Brooklyn Museum.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;**Cool (Less tourist, more New Yorker-y) Things to Do:**&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Highline&lt;/span&gt;](http://www.thehighline.org) I really, really love the highline. It can be a little crowded on the weekends, but if you go during a weekday, it’ll be fine. It’s in Chelsea (which is a fun area to explore). It used to be a railroad (originally built in the 1930s and hasn’t been used as such since 1980), but they’re in the multi-step process of converting it into a large, elevated park.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Frying Pan&lt;/span&gt; ](http://www.fryingpan.com/)is a bar on a boat. It’s everyone’s favorite place to drink outdoors. Fun fact: the boat was abandonded for 10 years and then underwater for 3 years before it was salvaged, acquired by its current owners and shipped to NYC where it’s currently docked at Pier 66 Maritime&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;5 Pointz&lt;/span&gt;](http://5ptz.com/) is right near my apartment (within walking distance). It’s an outdoor art (graffiti) space and it’s awesome (and free!) It’s one of New York’s lesser-known somewhat hidden gems in Long Island City. You can actually get great views of the building from the 7-train (in between the Court Square and Hunters Point stops). You can book a tour in advance as well if you want to do more than circle the exterior.&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
