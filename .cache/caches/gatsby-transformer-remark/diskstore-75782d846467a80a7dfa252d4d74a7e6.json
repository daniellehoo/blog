Located in New Canaan, CT, the Glass House is an archipelago of art, buildings and installations strategically laid out across the 47-acre historic preservation. The personal collection belonging to the late architect and designer is comprised of sculptures, paintings and personally designed structures drawing inspiration from different centuries of styles—i.e. the windows of the Brick House, which served as a more private bedroom and guesthouse, were taken from the Duomo in Florence, Italy—though the Glass House is hailed as a modern house monument. The majority of works were acquired by the architect himself during his long tenure of design and through the channels of his impressive network of artists and designer acquaintances—though some acquisitions were obtained and curated posthumously. The Glass House proper (which Johnson also shared with his life-partner, David Whitney) sits on the edge of a hill, overlooking a manmade pond and staircase sculpture. Uplighting was installed on the roof to illuminate the surrounding trees at night and the paths connecting the buildings are meticulously calculated, guiding visitors to take in the New England landscape.","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":93,"offset":162},"end":{"line":3,"column":1299,"offset":1368}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":70},"end":{"line":3,"column":1299,"offset":1368}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7427/10055384735_d66234dc1f_z.jpg","alt":null},"children":[],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":1370},"end":{"line":5,"column":69,"offset":1438}}},{"type":"text","value":"Frank Stella’s work in the art gallery","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":69,"offset":1438},"end":{"line":5,"column":107,"offset":1476}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1,"offset":1370},"end":{"line":5,"column":107,"offset":1476}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the most surprising works in the collection is the freestanding Nicolas Poussin piece in the ‘living room’ of the Glass House, ","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":1478},"end":{"line":7,"column":135,"offset":1612}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"em","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Burial of Phocion,","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":136,"offset":1613},"end":{"line":7,"column":154,"offset":1631}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":135,"offset":1612},"end":{"line":7,"column":155,"offset":1632}}},{"type":"text","value":" 1648-1649, that cries out as an anachronism in the otherwise majorly modern compound.
