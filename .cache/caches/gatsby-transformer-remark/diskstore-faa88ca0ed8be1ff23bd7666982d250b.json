While, they can be replicated in different locations, the situation is completely changed upon the moving of a sculpture. The dimensions and proportions aren’t all that’s important, but the color of the yarn and piece as a whole is constructed in proximity to it’s location and neighboring structures. The yarn is stretched in between points of the interior, and either produces floor-to-ceiling verticals or outlines closed forms. The idea is that the yarn, which has a slightly fuzzy property, loses its physical presence and turns into a dematerialized lines of color. The compositions also have an illusionistic effect where the colored lines appear to form the outline of transparent, glasslike planes.

His paradoxical play with material fact and perceptual illusion had philosophical implications. His sculptures define the edges of virtual shapes and the viewer’s brain is supposed to perceive the rest of the form—he wanted sculpture without a center. In this sense, he’s the anti-Ricard Serra because instead of forcing you into space, you are invited to move about freely within a space. You aren’t closed in and there’s no challenge in moving around the work—but quite the opposite. You’re free to move about and you always know where you stand with the work—which gives it a transcendent quality. The work is also reminiscent of Duchamp’s “Mile of Yarn” (1942) where the artist entangled a gallery space with 5,280 feet of yarn. The work occupies a post-modernism presentation because the gallery space is no longer neutral. The sculpture is supposed to be part of a continuing attitude and relationship to things—meaning that certain sculptures aren’t always seen as discrete objects, but more as instances of a generalized need to be in some sort of constituting relationship with the environment. Emerging during the heyday of Minimalism, Sandback’s art has separated itself from that of his immediate predecessors by its refusal to be reductively literal and material isn’t its primary mode of being. While the work itself is minimal, it’s conceptually based.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":2530},"end":{"line":9,"column":1484,"offset":4013},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":2530},"end":{"line":9,"column":1484,"offset":4013},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"“My work is full of illusions, but they don’t refer to anything.” -Sandback","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":4015},"end":{"line":11,"column":76,"offset":4090},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":4015},"end":{"line":11,"column":76,"offset":4090},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sandback grew up with an interest in stringed instruments, which is where his use of material comes into play.

He was attracted to this composition because he was able to manipulate something that was both existing and not existing at the same time. The forming of the figure—the shape and the dimension, had an “ambiguous and transient quality.” Sandback wanted to make sculpture, but he didn’t necessarily make a sculpture without a composition of parts or a sculpture without positive and negative spaces—but he wanted to make sculpture and these things seemed to be getting in the way for him.","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":4092},"end":{"line":13,"column":887,"offset":4978},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":4092},"end":{"line":13,"column":887,"offset":4978},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"He started exclusively using yarn around 1971, after in the last 1960s, he was making series of assemblages of industrial material.
