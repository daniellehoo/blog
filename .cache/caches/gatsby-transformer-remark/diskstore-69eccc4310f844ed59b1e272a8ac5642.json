I’ve stayed in my fair share of hostels over the years and this was definitely at the top of the list. The hostel was started by Ivi, who in turn, got his parents and siblings involved in the business. They run the hostel out of their home and cook breakfast for their travelers every morning in their kitchen. Breakfast is a social event and the whole family makes you feel integrated and like one of their own. They do a great job at giving you the opportunity to meet your fellow hostel mates, which is something I very much appreciated. The indoor/outdoor lounge/kitchen/wifi area and the optional the daily trips facilitate meet-ups and conversations with other travelers. Kay-Lin and I met Canadians, Brits and Aussies (in addition to one Kiwi, one Mexican, one Scottish fellow, one Chilean and two Swiss folks). Our room was in a satellite location (the apartment of an elderly neighbor), but we were still given ample opportunities to bond with the others and our bedroom/living arrangement was fantastic (not to mention impeccably clean and we even had own own balcony!)","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":233,"offset":1705},"end":{"line":13,"column":1314,"offset":2786}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":1473},"end":{"line":13,"column":1314,"offset":2786}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"One of the primary areas in Dubrovnik is Old City, where we explored the monastery, various churches, the synagogue and you can walk along the city walls.

We also took a ferry to the nearby island, Lokrum, which is covered with roaming peacocks. We hung out on a rock beach and went swimming in the Adriatic Sea. We also (accidentally) encountered a nude beach (mostly old dudes). The nude beaches are denoted by the letters “FKK,” which stands for Freikörperkultur and is a German movement whose name translates to Free Body Culture. This was something that we had to learn (twice) the hard way. The first time was on Lokrum and the second time was stumbling upon an FKK section of Cava beach with Matt the Australian from our hostel.

Then suddenly, as we were stuffing our faces with Nutella and fruit filled deliciousness, the power to the entire city went out and we found ourselves standing inside the walls of a fortified city in complete darkness. Kay-Lin and I then agree to have one, just one, drink with the group. We banded together to find a bar that was still serving drinks despite the power outage and our night of drinking commenced! After the power came back on, we stopped at a bodega for cigarettes and beer and headed to Revelin. A note about Revelin: it’s free to get into before 12:30 a.m. and if you are in Old City there is absolutely no way that you’ll miss it because a) it’s the only club anyone talks about b) there are girls in booty-shorts (hot pants as Ivi calls them) handing out fliers left and right and c) the rest of the bars are smaller, pubs and Old City is pretty small itself. The club is open until 6:00 a.m., there are dancers on stage, the music is mostly repetitive (house), the crowd is mostly a meat market (typical for European clubs), you can smoke indoors, there are no windows, but it’s a trashy good time. Our group then proceeded to dance like assholes for several hours in an exclusive circle and it was a great night (that was supposed to just be crepes and then only supposed to be one drink).
