Bowing to censorship and citing the safety of its visitors, staff and artists in the show, the Guggenheim ultimately decided to censor its own exhibition after receiving a number of violent threats. The three works pulled, which all involve animals, are “Dogs That Cannot Touch Each Other,” “Theater of the World” and “A Case Study of Transference.” According to the New York Times, these works were pieces chosen among around 150 works, mostly experimental art and many shocking and intending to challenge authority and use of animals (in video) and to call attention to the violence of humankind.

This decision makes me angry. While I’m totally pro-animal rights (fuck factory farms, fuck puppy mills, fuck declawing your cat), Sun Yuan and Pen Yu operate in a space that’s supposed to be controversial and it was only a video of their work that was to be shown–documentation that was not meant to send a pro-animal abuse message. This whole body of work is trying to say something about human rights and how we exist in the contemporary moment and the people signing that petition clearly don’t understand the work. It’s this angry hive mentality that can be dangerous–especially when it doesn’t really understand what it’s doing with the power that it doesn’t even realize it has.
