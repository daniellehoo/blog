The room that holds this exhibit is eerie, with images of school children and Dracula looming about. While the work speaks for itself, there is an overwhelming and overpowering sense of darkness in the exhibition, overshadowed by the artist’s recent suicide. It’s hard not to consider the psychological state of one who produces such an expansive oeuvre over the course of three decades.
