It’s a completely immersive experience that is unique to each viewer (the exhibition will be at <a href=\"http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/philippe_parreno\">the Armory through August 2</a>) and I’d recommend giving yourself at least two hours if your goal is to watch all of the video art that comprises the installation. A cylindrical contraption, that acts as seating in the space, holds viewers and slowly rotates following the videos and the periodic light/sound pieces. Somewhat meta in nature due to the content of some videos, the piece really makes you contemplate your very own presence/placement within the exhibition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/541/19001775225_ee958f4aeb_z.jpg\"></p>"}
