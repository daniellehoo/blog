Another analogy I’ve heard it likened to is Disney World–like a futile attempt to hit all of the different parks in only a few days’ time. It’s virtually impossible/insane to see everything that the Armory Show and accompanying satellite fairs (ADAA, Volta, Pulse, Scope, Art on Paper, Independent, Spring/Break, (Un)Scene, etc.) have to offer in the less than a week time block. This year I managed to hit The Armory Show, Volta, (Un)Scene, and Spring/Break. Volta has remained my favorite show for the second year in a row because of it’s organization (it moved to Pier 90–adjacent to The Armory Show this year) and it’s accessibility to the art–one of the best features is the leaflets with descriptions of the artwork that each booth offers. Other highlights included free Ben &#x26; Jerry’s (and admission) at (Un)Scene and the former post-office/Herald Square location of Spring/Break (which was formally housed in a old Catholic school).</p>\n<p>Any who–here are my favorite pieces from Volta.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7635/16912398262_9ccc7e31fc_z.jpg\">dNASAb, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, “Plasticized Vortex,” 2015</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8755/16706331217_01738a2f92_z.jpg\">Petrina Hicks, This is No Fantasy + Dianne Tanzer Gallery, “Venus,” 2013  </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8695/16912646611_e60568817e_z.jpg\">Travis Somerville, Beta Pictoris Gallery, “Well Division,” 2009, vintage porcelain drinking fountains and panels, copper pipes, running water</p>"}
