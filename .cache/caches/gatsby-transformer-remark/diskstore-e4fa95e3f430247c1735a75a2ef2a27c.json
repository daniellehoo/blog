Volta still remains one of my favorite pieces of Armory Week–mostly because of the environment (they somehow manage to achieve a maximum level of tranquility with ample space and the help of a soft grey carpeted floor). I went on Thursday (albeit the day after their free, public Vernissage) and it was such a pleasant experience compared to other experiences this week. SPRING/BREAK has changed a lot since it’s pre-2014 days when it was located in a former Lower East Side school. It has since partnered with Artsy and while it tries to be a homegrown/DIY/curator focused anti-art fair (which, for all intensive purposes, it still is), its increasingly higher-brow patrons looking to ‘see what those kids in Bushwick are up to these days,’ make it feel more and more like the very thing that it tries not to be. While everyone complains that The Armory Show starts to get repetitive after successive years–the same galleries showing the same artists in the exact same booth locations–Volta does a good job at mixing it up and showing a decent sampling of solo projects from emerging international artists. They also try to make the whole experience ‘feel like an intense sequence of studio visits.’","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":122},"end":{"line":4,"column":1353,"offset":1474},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":122},"end":{"line":4,"column":1353,"offset":1474},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"image","title":null,"url":"https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1591/25942257595_6094093390_z.jpg","alt":null,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":1479},"end":{"line":7,"column":70,"offset":1548},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"Anthony Goicolea with Galeria Senda in Barcelona","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":70,"offset":1548},"end":{"line":7,"column":118,"offset":1596},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1,"offset":1479},"end":{"line":7,"column":118,"offset":1596},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"My favorite booth at Volta this year was Anthony Goicelea’s work with Galeria Senda in Barcelona (pictured above).
