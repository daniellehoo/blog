The highlights of the trip included: The Museum Soumaya (amazing building, less than impressive collection/curation inside), Frida’s Casa Azul (I’ve been wanting to make a pilgrimage there for ages), the artist’s collective Casa Maauad, Galeria OMR, Kurimanzutto, attending a Lucha Libra fight, staying at the Camino Real Polanco, climbing the Teotihuacan ruins, visiting artist Pedro Reyes’ studio, visiting the Museo Jumux, visiting the Diego Rivera-Anahuacalli and seeing Casa Luis Barragan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5114/14047451109_ee0b8bfaba_z.jpg\">Teotihuacan</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5154/14233998154_de950217d6_z.jpg\">Pedro Reyes’ Studio</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14211105816_92a0864da7_z.jpg\">The Blue House</p>\n<p>The following week, I traveled with 4 others from my program to Tulum–where we relaxed on the beach, swam in a cenote, hiked Tulum ruins and ate the most amazing Mexico food.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5311/14047572679_f3d57b02f0_z.jpg\">Tulum</p>"}
