The first stop was at a local fruit stand along the way to sample, well, local fruits! Nothing out of the ordinary, peaches and plums and grapes (all amazing fresh and delicious). The next stop was the town of Kravica, Bosnia to swim in waterfalls. This place was-a pretty well kept secret and with the exception of our group and some locals, it was not crowded at all. The area was littered with dragonflies and the water was freezing, but well worth the dip to gain access to the groves behind the waterfalls.","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":1087},"end":{"line":11,"column":852,"offset":1938}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1,"offset":1087},"end":{"line":11,"column":852,"offset":1938}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After the waterfalls, we had lunch at a place called Udovice, where we had lamb, potatoes, salad, cheese, chocolate cake (not to mention amazing wine and brandy).","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":1940},"end":{"line":13,"column":163,"offset":2102}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":1,"offset":1940},"end":{"line":13,"column":163,"offset":2102}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The next stop was Mostar (pictured at the top of the post), a Muslim town, to see jumpers jump off of the Stari Most (Old Bridge), which is a reconstruction of a 16th-century Ottoman bridge that crosses the Neretva river.
