Currently there’s also a <a href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/RobertIndiana\">Robert Indian exhibit (Beyond Love)</a> running though January 5, 2014 and a <a href=\"http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/TJWilcox\">T.J. Wilcox (In the Air) video instillation</a> running through February 9, 2014 at the museum. My mother was <strong><em>very</em></strong> excited about seeing the Hopper exhibit before it closes on Sunday. The collection highlights the drawings and creative process of American realist painter and printmaker, Edward Hopper (1882-1967). Since we’re often viewing the final work products of painters, we tend to forget the work involved that goes into making a finished piece.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/3767/10093221243_c447e31b95_b.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Perkins Youngboy Dos Passos, 1941, Fabricated chalk on paper</p>\n<p>The following drawing and painting series reminds me of Vista Market in Pound Ridge, NY.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3834/10093114634_34ec0eaef5_z.jpg\">Study for Gas, 1940, Fabricated chalk on paper</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7381/10093175266_64c1b4b351_z.jpg\">Study for Gas, 1940, Charcoal and white chalk with graphite pencil on paper</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2889/10093150275_76e6d8c9fc_z.jpg\">Gas, 1940, Oil on canvas</p>"}
