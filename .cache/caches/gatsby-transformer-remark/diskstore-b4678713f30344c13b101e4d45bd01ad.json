The first night of our arrival, we were pretty drained so we just showered and got dinner in Plaka (cold octopus, hummus, olives and tahini sauce) near the hostel. The next morning, since we only had one full day in Athens, we walked all around the city and visited the must-sees. The main attractions we ventured to were the Acropolis (where the Parthenon, the Theater of Dionysos and the Erechtheion can be found), the Temple of Zeus, the Hephaistion, the Ancient Agora (market), and the National Gardens. The Parthenon was a under construction and surrounded by three cranes, so that took away a bit from its enjoyment. I think that the Temple of Zeus was my favorite monument because although it was sparse, it was unadulterated and there was virtually no one else viewing it (as opposed to the Parthenon, which was flooded with tourists).
