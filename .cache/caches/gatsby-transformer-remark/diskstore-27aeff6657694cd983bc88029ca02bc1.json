While I was not completely happy with our guide (he worked in tandem with a driver, who did not speak English) for a host of reasons (mainly, all of the ‘artisan shops’ he took us to were shams/schemes to jack up prices for tourists), we covered a lot more ground that we would have without him and it enabled us to make the most of the little time that we had in Fes. We visited the Jewish Quarter and went into a synagogue (but missed the Jewish cemetery because it was closed for Shabbat); saw various artisan shops (pottery, weaving, rugs and the tannery–the tanner being the highlight); had a ‘nus nus’ (or half-half–half espresso and half milk; note that Moroccans do enjoy their coffee as much as they enjoy their mint tea); and we ended with a local lunch with our guide in the souqs in a very small meat shop–where we had lamb sandwiches and mint tea. In the evening, we heard the sounds of drums and horns and followed it into the streets. There we found a Moroccan wedding passing in front of our Riad, which we proceeded to follow for a solid 30 minutes.
