When Lena Dunham’s Not That Kind of Girl was sold out in bookstores last Christmas, this was my alternative. Gay dives into contemporary politics and culture, but I found her analyses a little bit shallow and definitely lacking depth. Her works brush the surface and I know that the collection is supposed to be funny and entertaining, but I did not think that it delivered any sort of refreshing commentary.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2oxyu1N3W1rrv3jbo1_500.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff</strong></p>\n<p>This short read uses A. A. Milne’s stories and characters as allegorical devices to explaining the basic tenets of taoism. Pooh’s carefree and simple-minded nature embodies effortless being– the core principle of the Tao.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/8117HB7WbvL.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong></p>\n<p>The heavy Russian classic about morality. It’s a “courtroom drama” satire, but it’s deeply about family relations. An interesting line and perhaps theme in the novel is that everyone has a secret (or perhaps not-so-secret) desire for their father to die.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388282563l/20995.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene</strong></p>\n<p>The Art of Seduction outlines the art of manipulation and basic psychology/a look into the human psyche. The book catalogues people into different personality types and discusses various seduction techniques to “make people fall under your spell.” I think it’s more useful for the way he labels people into different boxes based on their seduction types and eighteen types of victims than a pick-up-artist guide. Everything comes down to power here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://litbeetle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/the-sun-also-rises.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway</strong></p>\n<p>‘The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation,’ post-World War I outlining 1920s Europe from Paris to bullfighting in Spain with a group of expats. A quick-read and prime example of Hemingway’s simple, but effective prose. A great quote from the book: “You can’t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61O-ltKJb9L._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez</strong></p>\n<p>A fascinating novel from the author of Love in the Time of Cholera detailing the multi-generational story of the Buendía family. The patriarch/quasi-protagonist in the work, José Arcadio Buendía founds the fictional town of Macondo (metaphoric Colombia). The book weaves the themes of war, love and the the occult together to paint a vivid family portrait.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ckYWIZtNL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"></p>\n<p><strong>The Bhagavad Gita</strong></p>\n<p>Hindu scripture written in verse–a narrative dialogue between Prince Arjuna and his spiritual guide, Lord Krishna. On the brink of war, Krishna coaches Arjuna to ‘fulfill his duty as a warrior and establish Dharma.’</p>"}
