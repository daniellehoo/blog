The article discusses the exhibition’s 30 pieces compiled from the museum’s Ancient Egyptian collection, the Egyptian’s fascination with cats, and the link between life on earth and the supernatural thereafter. The Ancient Egyptians did not worship cats per se, but they created their god with cat-like physical features. In the first millennium B.C., cults of feline-goddesses became widespread and increased the demand for votive sculptures for offerings. Priests bred cats specifically for this purpose and examinations of mummies concluded that, at certain temples, kittens were killed (usually by having their necks snapped) and inserted into sculptures which were then sold to pilgrims. Ancient Egypt’s patriarchal society gave way to the belief that goddesses (and women) were unpredictable and dangerous (like cats) and played the dual roles of ruthless killer and nurturing mother.","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":226,"offset":1626},"end":{"line":12,"column":1189,"offset":2589}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1401},"end":{"line":12,"column":1189,"offset":2589}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"After the museum, we ventured into Park Slope to ","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":2591},"end":{"line":14,"column":50,"offset":2640}}},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"http://www.bierkraft.com/"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Bierkraft,","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":51,"offset":2641},"end":{"line":14,"column":61,"offset":2651}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":50,"offset":2640},"end":{"line":14,"column":89,"offset":2679}}},{"type":"text","value":" a foodie’s paradise offering an expansive selection of craft beer, artisanal cheeses, gourmet chocolates, and homemade ice cream sandwiches.
