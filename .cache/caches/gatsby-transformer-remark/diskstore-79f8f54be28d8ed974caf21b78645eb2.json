I was originally slated to go to NYU’s Institute of Fine Arts to study Italian Renaissance Art, but I decided to switch gears and go a slightly different route at Sotheby’s. While I still love the realism and religious subject matter of Italian Renaissance Art and it will always hold a special place in my heart because I studied abroad in Florence back in 2008, professionally and in terms of practicality this move is the right one.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":132},"end":{"line":4,"column":657,"offset":788},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":132},"end":{"line":4,"column":657,"offset":788},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"A little bit about SIA: the New York branch just opened in 2006, so the program is still in its infancy. The specific program I’m in focuses on Post-War art (1945-present) and walks students through theoretical and analytical methods to approaching art. Students have the option of completing a third semester in London or New York or they can opt to write a thesis during the summer/early fall following their second semester. This semester my classes include: Contemporary Art: 1945-Present, Theories of Post-War Art, Research Methodologies: Writing about Contemporary Art and The Work of Art, from Studio to Museum.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":790},"end":{"line":6,"column":619,"offset":1408},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":790},"end":{"line":6,"column":619,"offset":1408},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Why I’m excited for this program: 1) It means that I’m back in school and I’ve really missed the world of academia–this is where I thrive. 2) The curriculum incorporates a travel component–this semester we’re going to visit the Venice Biennale and in the spring we’re going to Dubai. 3) I get to study art history in the artistic epicenter of the international art world. There are also site visits to local galleries, museums, and exhibitions. There are periodic artist lectures and there’s a vast alum network. Classes started this Monday and we’re already in full swing. It’s wonderful to be an art student and I couldn’t be happier with my decision.","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":1410},"end":{"line":8,"column":654,"offset":2063},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":1410},"end":{"line":8,"column":654,"offset":2063},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":8,"column":654,"offset":2063}}}}
