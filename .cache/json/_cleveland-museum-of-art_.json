(Side note: American Airlines is terrible, our flight from Laguardia got cancelled and we had to drive seven hours through the night to get there). The collection covered antiquity through present and while their collection isn’t stellar (through they do have a holding of many large artists), I really enjoyed how the works are displayed, the flow of the museum, and the architecture of the building.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4299/35978037341_9a051fbb86_z.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Atrium</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4301/35978038061_2978292cee_z.jpg\">Frederic Edwin Church, Twilight in the Wilderness (background)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/36069630446_28de672002_z.jpg\">Robert Gober</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cleveland Museum of Art","date":"July 23, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/cleveland-museum-of-art/","prev":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-future-we-can-vibe-with/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Future We Can Vibe With"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/london-copenhagen-and-stockholm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"London, Copenhagen, and Stockholm"}}}}
