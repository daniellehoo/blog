Words never do artwork justice&#8211;but the third floor which was dedicated to a body of work inspired by the &#8220;Blue Devils&#8221;&#8211;a Trinidadian reference from Carnival that also represents a political reference to police and their relationship with black men. The exhibition as a whole was moving and Ofili (recipient of the Tuner prize and embroiled in controversy when former major Giuliani chastised his &#8220;The Holy Virgin Mary&#8221; painting in 1999) lives up to his reputation as the contemporary Gauguin. Ofili is notorious for using elephant dung in his work. His paintings are vibrant, sensual, emotional, and thought-provoking.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8640/16443524158_2556827992_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Ovid-Actaeon&#8221;</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 503px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8567/16008524554_d59c3b4be6_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"493\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Shithead&#8221;</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 566px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8627/16423393747_80691dfde5_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8220;Afromuses&#8221;</p></div></p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"chris-ofili-night-and-day-at-the-new-museum"}}}
