Displayed in serial grids and organized into 25 chapters, <i>Analogue</i> documents the eclipsed texture of 20th-century urban life as seen in vanishing mom-and-pop stores and the simultaneous emergence of the global rag trade. Leonard took her own New York neighborhood, Manhattan’s Lower East Side, as a point of departure in the late 1990s. She then followed the circulation of recycled merchandise—used clothing, discarded advertisements, and the old technology of Kodak camera shops—to far-flung markets in Africa, Eastern Europe, Cuba, Mexico, and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>The disappearing storefronts and neglected products are echoed in the obsolete technology the artist used to reproduce them: a vintage 1940s Rolleiflex camera, a tool “left over from the mechanical age,” as Leonard put it, along with gelatin silver and chromogenic printing processes. Tapping the traditions of documentary and conceptual photography, <i>Analogue</i> is positioned in the genealogy of grand visual archives that extends from Eugène Atget’s compendium of Paris to Martha Rosler’s photo-text work on New York’s Bowery. Leonard’s project is an urgent document and a poetic allegory of globalization that reveals the circulation of goods and the homogenization of diverse geographical locations in the 21st century.</p>\n<p class=\"top\">In my own crappy words: There&#8217;s some beauty about capturing things as they fade into obsolescence. It especially resonates for me because I worked a bit on the Kodak bankruptcy/restructuring case&#8211;so here all of my worlds are colliding as these photos are plastered to the walls of my new workplace.</p>\n<p>Zoe Leonard: <em>Analogue</em> runs through August 30, 2015.</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"zoe-leonard-analogue"}}}
