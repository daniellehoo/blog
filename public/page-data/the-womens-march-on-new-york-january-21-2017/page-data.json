It was a small victory in the resistance movement and many more protests will be on the horizon during this administration—there&#8217;s one today in Battery Park to rally against the Muslim Ban Executive Order signed on Friday and there were several yesterday at airports around the country (JFK, SFO, LAX, ORD and Dulles) to protest the same—as many were being detained at airports after the order was signed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/707/31780515973_b00019ec0d_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/680/31780516253_89bd6fc751_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"554\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/727/31780515843_88d55e47d5_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-womens-march-on-new-york-january-21-2017"}}}
