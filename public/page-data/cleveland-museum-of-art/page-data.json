(Side note: American Airlines is terrible, our flight from Laguardia got cancelled and we had to drive seven hours through the night to get there). The collection covered antiquity through present and while their collection isn&#8217;t stellar (through they do have a holding of many large artists), I really enjoyed how the works are displayed, the flow of the museum, and the architecture of the building.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4299/35978037341_9a051fbb86_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Atrium</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 545px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4301/35978038061_2978292cee_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"535\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Frederic Edwin Church, Twilight in the Wilderness (background)</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 556px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4307/36069630446_28de672002_z.jpg\" width=\"546\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robert Gober</p></div></p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cleveland-museum-of-art"}}}
