I&#8217;m currently in my post-travel city funk. I have this love/hate relationship with this city, and whenever I tell those I meet during my travels where I&#8217;m from, I&#8217;m met with amazement and a cascade of inquiries and excitement. &#8220;What&#8217;s it like living in New York?&#8221; &#8220;I&#8217;d love to visit someday.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re so lucky!&#8221; Sure, living in New York is great, but when I&#8217;m abroad I&#8217;m always reminded of what this city could do better. Maybe it&#8217;s the true New Yorker in me speaking when I say that because we&#8217;re always looking for the next best thing, but my number one lamentation about this city is that it&#8217;s difficult (but not impossible) to solidify personal relationships here. Enough about that&#8211;back to my travels.</p>\n<p>I have a goal to visit at least one new country per year. Since 2010, I&#8217;ve successfully accomplished this endeavor. Here are my world travels thus far:</p>\n<p><strong>2006:</strong> Dominican Republic (High school spring break; Cities visited: Puerta Plata).</p>\n<p><strong>2008:</strong> Italy (Studied abroad through The University of Connecticut; Cities visited: Florence, Venice, Rome, Sienna, San Gimignano, Pisa).</p>\n<p><strong>2010:</strong> The Bahamas, Bermuda.</p>\n<p><strong>2011:</strong> Ireland (Dublin), France (Paris), Spain (Barcelona and Seville), Italy (Naples, Capri).</p>\n<p><strong>2012:</strong> England (London), Czech Republic (Prague), The Netherlands (Amsterdam), Brazil (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).</p>\n<p><strong>2013:</strong> Greece (Athens and Santorini), Croatia (Dubrovnik), Bosnia (Mostar), Montenegro (Kotor).</p>\n<p>I just got back from Greece and Croatia, but my eternal compulsion to be a globetrotter can never be quelled. In Greece, I visited Athens and Santorini and in Croatia I stayed in Dubrovnik (with day trips to Bosnia and Montenegro). Each city deserves its own posting and in the upcoming days I will dedicate one post to each city I visited on this trip (and then I will start with back-posts for cities from previous trips).</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Danielle</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"another-trip-in-the-books"}}}
