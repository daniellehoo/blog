His minimalist and &#8216;post-painterly&#8217; works have undoubtedly paved the way for subsequent minimalist and post-minimalist works. The current Stella Retrospective at the Whitney is the most comprehensive to-date and features a wide array of the artist&#8217;s works from the 1950s through present. The show diverges from his most well-known works (the Black Series) and presents many lesser-known 3-D pieces from his later works.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/23352194541_f852044aa1_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5746/23326264522_a82dac1d14_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5766/23434727975_ae9686b494_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5677/23408577836_7426c47a8e_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5704/23138946040_b1f447deea_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"frank-stella-at-the-whitney"}}}
