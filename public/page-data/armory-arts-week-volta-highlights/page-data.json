Another analogy I&#8217;ve heard it likened to is Disney World&#8211;like a futile attempt to hit all of the different parks in only a few days&#8217; time.  It&#8217;s virtually impossible/insane to see everything that the Armory Show and accompanying satellite fairs (ADAA, Volta, Pulse, Scope, Art on Paper, Independent, Spring/Break, (Un)Scene, etc.) have to offer in the less than a week time block. This year I managed to hit The Armory Show, Volta, (Un)Scene, and Spring/Break. Volta has remained my favorite show for the second year in a row because of it&#8217;s organization (it moved to Pier 90&#8211;adjacent to The Armory Show this year) and it&#8217;s accessibility to the art&#8211;one of the best features is the leaflets with descriptions of the artwork that each booth offers. Other highlights included free Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s (and admission) at (Un)Scene and the former post-office/Herald Square location of Spring/Break (which was formally housed in a old Catholic school).</p>\n<p>Any who&#8211;here are my favorite pieces from Volta.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7635/16912398262_9ccc7e31fc_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">dNASAb, Frederieke Taylor Gallery, &#8220;Plasticized Vortex,&#8221; 2015</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8755/16706331217_01738a2f92_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Petrina Hicks, This is No Fantasy + Dianne Tanzer Gallery, &#8220;Venus,&#8221; 2013</p></div></p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8695/16912646611_e60568817e_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travis Somerville, Beta Pictoris Gallery, &#8220;Well Division,&#8221; 2009, vintage porcelain drinking fountains and panels, copper pipes, running water</p></div></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"armory-arts-week-volta-highlights"}}}
