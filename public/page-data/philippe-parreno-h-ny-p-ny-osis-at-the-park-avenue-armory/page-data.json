It&#8217;s a completely immersive experience that is unique to each viewer (the exhibition will be at <a href=\"http://www.armoryonpark.org/programs_events/detail/philippe_parreno\" target=\"_blank\">the Armory through August 2</a>) and I&#8217;d recommend giving yourself at least two hours if your goal is to watch all of the video art that comprises the installation. A cylindrical contraption, that acts as seating in the space, holds viewers and slowly rotates following the videos and the periodic light/sound pieces. Somewhat meta in nature due to the content of some videos, the piece really makes you contemplate your very own presence/placement within the exhibition.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/541/19001775225_ee958f4aeb_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"philippe-parreno-h-ny-p-ny-osis-at-the-park-avenue-armory"}}}
