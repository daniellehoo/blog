It features 24 weatherproof steel plates. Serra’s work is also featured as a permanent part of the Dia:Beacon collection. He is considered a minimalist artist (sculptor) and is known for his steels works that forcefully manipulate and contour the viewer’s body into a confined space. His background as a steel worker influenced his signature medium choice.\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 522px\">![](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/11914309074_425dd3733f_z.jpg)Richard Serra, 7 Plates, 6 Angles, 2013, Weatherproof steel\n</div>Also on display at the 555 gallery are *7 Plates, 6 Angles* (2013) (pictured above), G*rief and Reason (for Walter)*, (2013) (not pictured) for Walter De Maria, a close friend of Serra’s, who died this past July, and *Counterweights*, (2013) (not pictured).\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 514px\">![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/11914734646_5444780ea5_z.jpg)Richard Serra, *Inside Out*, 2013, Weatherproof steel\n</div>The space at the 522 gallery is dedicated to a single work made of curved, *Inside Out* (2013) (pictured above). The work is maze-like and the large contours of the structure push the viewer into several space pockets while towering into the tall gallery space.","frontmatter":{"title":"Richard Serra New Sculpture at Gagosian","date":"January 12, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/richard-serra-new-sculpture-at-gagosian/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/macho-man-tell-it-to-my-heart/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Macho Man, Tell It To My Heart"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/everything-ive-read-in-2013/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Everything I&#8217;ve Read in 2013"}}}}}
