When Lena Dunham&#8217;s Not That Kind of Girl was sold out in bookstores last Christmas, this was my alternative. Gay dives into contemporary politics and culture, but I found her analyses a little bit shallow and definitely lacking depth. Her works brush the surface and I know that the collection is supposed to be funny and entertaining, but I did not think that it delivered any sort of refreshing commentary.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2oxyu1N3W1rrv3jbo1_500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"428\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Tao of Pooh by Benjamin Hoff</strong></p>\n<p>This short read uses  A. A. Milne&#8217;s stories and characters as allegorical devices to explaining the basic tenets of taoism. Pooh&#8217;s carefree and simple-minded nature embodies effortless being&#8211; the core principle of the Tao.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/8117HB7WbvL.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"333\" height=\"497\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</strong></p>\n<p>The heavy Russian classic about morality. It&#8217;s a &#8220;courtroom drama&#8221; satire, but it&#8217;s deeply about family relations. An interesting line and perhaps theme in the novel is that everyone has a secret (or perhaps not-so-secret) desire for their father to die.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1388282563l/20995.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"318\" height=\"460\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene</strong></p>\n<p>The Art of Seduction outlines the art of manipulation and basic psychology/a look into the human psyche. The book catalogues people into different personality types and discusses various seduction techniques to &#8220;make people fall under your spell.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s more useful for the way he labels people into different boxes based on their seduction types and eighteen types of victims than a pick-up-artist guide. Everything comes down to power here.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://litbeetle.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/the-sun-also-rises.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"527\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway</strong></p>\n<p>&#8216;The quintessential novel of the Lost Generation,&#8217; post-World War I outlining 1920s Europe from Paris to bullfighting in Spain with a group of expats. A quick-read and prime example of Hemingway&#8217;s simple, but effective prose. A great quote from the book: “You can&#8217;t get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61O-ltKJb9L._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"499\" /></p>\n<p><strong>100 Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez</strong></p>\n<p>A fascinating novel from the author of Love in the Time of Cholera detailing the multi-generational story of the Buendía family. The patriarch/quasi-protagonist in the work, José Arcadio Buendía founds the fictional town of Macondo (metaphoric Colombia). The book weaves the themes of war, love and the the occult together to paint a vivid family portrait.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ckYWIZtNL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"276\" height=\"448\" /></p>\n<p><strong>The Bhagavad Gita</strong></p>\n<p>Hindu scripture written in verse&#8211;a narrative dialogue between Prince Arjuna and his spiritual guide, Lord Krishna.
