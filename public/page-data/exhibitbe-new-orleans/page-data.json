Having been there three times now, I can honestly see myself moving there at some point. My one regret about this trip: (ok, two) I wish I saw more art (and took more time to scout out the galleries on Royal Street) and I wish I listened to more live music. John did take me to ExhibitBE&#8211;an amazing work of outdoor graffiti that covers unoccupied five-story buildings. Sort of what 5-Pointz was to Queens/Long Island City, ExhibitBE is to NoLA. A true celebration of street art&#8211;I present here, some of the highlights.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7770/18214958805_8baa6663c5_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7748/18214959615_2267512d2c_z.jpg\" alt=\"n5\" width=\"594\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7733/18214961725_21773e27b6_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8894/17594357313_46c9faab50_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8773/17592338024_ac8ba3c0b9_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8832/18216187171_272c693f2d_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"exhibitbe-new-orleans"}}}
