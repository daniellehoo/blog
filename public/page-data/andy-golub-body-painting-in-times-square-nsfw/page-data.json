The models, along with Golub&#8217;s custom painted car, were part of a photo shoot and swarms of tourists/amateur photographers crowded around to snap some raunchy shots. Golub&#8217;s subjects ranged from young to elderly and slender to pudgy. Since there were so many people crowding around the front sides of the models, I was only able to capture the gang from the back (this may have been for the best).</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;\"> </span><img class=\"alignnone\" style=\"line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.8em;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9616003111_ff2929f592_z.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /></p>\n<p>The artist held another &#8220;show&#8221; in Times Square <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2013/07/10/naked_models_take_over_times_square.php#photo-1\" target=\"_blank\">back in July</a>, with only two models. One of his models was arrested in 2011 for public nudity and Golub has been arrested for charges of public lewdness.
