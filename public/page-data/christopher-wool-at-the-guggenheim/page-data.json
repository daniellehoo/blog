Currently the main exhibition is <em>Christopher Wool, </em>which is on view until January 22, 2014&#8211;but there is also a small Kandinsky exhibit (Kandinsky in Paris 1934-1944) and a Motherwell exhibit (Motherwell: Early Collages) that I really enjoyed.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 426px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3750/11659068196_3c127f77dd_z.jpg\" width=\"416\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Untitled, 2000</p></div></p>\n<p>The above painting is emblematic and the main painterly style that is attributed to Wool. Wool, like many other painters, experimented with text, monochromes, flatness and figureless works to &#8220;bring painting to an end.&#8221; His works are often graphic.  <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/a-christopher-wool-show-at-the-guggenheim.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> cites something problematic with the show&#8211;it seems padded&#8211;with three series of grainy Wool photographs. The show did feel a little bit repetitive and I found myself rushing down the rotunda to the end. After I saw a few key graphic pieces, I was satisfied with the trip. My favorite pieces were the ones that combined forms of abstraction with graphics in the background such as the following <em>Untitled</em> from 2002.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 432px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3715/11658644514_96371388f5_z.jpg\" width=\"422\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Untitled, 2002</p></div></p>\n<p>This piece is enamel and silkscreen ink on linen.</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"christopher-wool-at-the-guggenheim"}}}
