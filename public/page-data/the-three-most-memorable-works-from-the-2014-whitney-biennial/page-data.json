When assembling a comprehensive body of work that large how can one really avoid frazzledness? I think that it accomplished its aims&#8211;typifying contemporaneity and providing a semblance of &#8220;the art world today,&#8221; which is not an easy feat. The Biennial was curated according to floor, each one with a different curator and mission statement. I don&#8217;t think it was a coincident that all of my tops picks were from the same floor&#8211;the third floor curated by Stuart Comer whose attempt was to &#8220;provide a kaleidoscopic glimpse of this historic moment.&#8221; Comer utilized a variety of different mediums, styles, identities and tastes.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick #1: Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, <em>Relationship Series</em>, 2008-2013. [Pictured above]<br />\n</strong>This beautiful series documents two transgendered individuals in a relationship while transitioning (in opposite directions) from one sex to another. The salon-hung pictures are visually captivating and offer an alluringly intimate portrayal into the lives of these lovers.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2922/14262129623_0de890ccef_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Film Still from Leviathan</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Pick #2: Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel, <em>Leviathan</em>, 2012<br />\n</strong>This very visceral work documents the North American fishing industry in 87-minutes of mesmerizing footage. I found myself sitting on the floor of this mini-theater for a good 20 minutes before I could pull myself away from the screen. I would love to watch the film in its entirety in another setting.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 506px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Bjarne Melgaard, Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby, 2014\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14218889836_53e0a00b40_z.jpg\" width=\"496\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bjarne Melgaard, <em>Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby</em>, 2014</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Pick #3: Bjarne Melgaard, <i>Think I’m Gonna Have A Baby</i>, 2014</strong><br />\nIt&#8217;s a room-sized installation complete with Skrillex pillows, half-naked mannequins, and an over-stimulating series of video and sound projections. I think that this room perfectly exemplifies what our lives have become as we become increasingly reliant on technology and the distractions that we coexist with as a product of our artificially created symbiotic relationship with inanimate objects.</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-three-most-memorable-works-from-the-2014-whitney-biennial"}}}
