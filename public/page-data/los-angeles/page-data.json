The last time I was in LA was 2008, and I spent part of that trip in Anaheim at Disneyland–so it was great to see the city through a completely different (art centric) lens. East Coasters and New Yorkers in particular love to hate on LA, but the trip was pretty great overall and I would definitely at least consider moving there.\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of the trip:</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 551px\">![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4164/34511937275_ef39f82422_z.jpg)Jean-Michel Basquiat (@ The Broad)\n</div>**Friday, March 31**\n<p>I arrived late on Thursday night, after some delays and maybe the most turbulent flight I’ve ever experienced. Someone in the row behind me threw up and a teenager on a school trip kept flipping his tray table up and down (until I asked him to stop). I’m seated in a row right behind a set of bathrooms and there’s the looming smell of toilet in the air. I engage in a 6-hour armrest battle with my seat neighbor. Commercial flights are just filled with life’s small pleasures.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 524px\">![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4160/34511935315_ee5e5ff2e5_z.jpg)The Broad, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro\n</div>The jet lag is real–I consistently woke up around 6:00 a.m. (EST) throughout the trip. This is what being a morning person must be like. Spent the day setting up at The Broad (for our meeting the following Monday). Then caught dinner with some colleagues at [Norah](http://norahrestaurant.com/).\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 490px\">![](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4158/34511935905_54ba59bc80_z.jpg)Takashi Murakami (@ The Broad)\n</div>**Saturday, April 1**\n<p>This is the first official day of our work program.
