The last time I was in LA was 2008, and I spent part of that trip in Anaheim at Disneyland&#8211;so it was great to see the city through a completely different (art centric) lens. East Coasters and New Yorkers in particular love to hate on LA, but the trip was pretty great overall and I would definitely at least consider moving there.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a breakdown of the trip:</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 551px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4164/34511937275_ef39f82422_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jean-Michel Basquiat (@ The Broad)</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Friday, March 31</strong></p>\n<p>I arrived late on Thursday night, after some delays and maybe the most turbulent flight I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Someone in the row behind me threw up and a teenager on a school trip kept flipping his tray table up and down (until I asked him to stop). I&#8217;m seated in a row right behind a set of bathrooms and there&#8217;s the looming smell of toilet in the air. I engage in a 6-hour armrest battle with my seat neighbor. Commercial flights are just filled with life&#8217;s small pleasures.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 524px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4160/34511935315_ee5e5ff2e5_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"514\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Broad, designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro</p></div></p>\n<p>The jet lag is real&#8211;I consistently woke up around 6:00 a.m. (EST) throughout the trip. This is what being a morning person must be like. Spent the day setting up at The Broad (for our meeting the following Monday). Then caught dinner with some colleagues at <a href=\"http://norahrestaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Norah</a>.</p>\n<p><div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4158/34511935905_54ba59bc80_z.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Takashi Murakami (@ The Broad)</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>Saturday, April 1</strong></p>\n<p>This is the first official day of our work program.

The grounds (and garden) are pretty incredible, but the collection and exhibitions are definitely a bit hard to navigate since the building is basically housed in four separate factionsÂ (north, south, east and west).</p>\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"los-angeles"}}}
